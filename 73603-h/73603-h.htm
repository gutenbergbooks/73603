<p class='c007'>“Ouch! Oh, dear! My! My!”</p>

<p class='c008'>That was what Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy
heard one day in the hollow stump bungalow.
She was just getting breakfast for Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness me sakes alive and a basket
of potato chips!” cried Nurse Jane, accidentally
dropping a stewed carrot into the turnip marmalade.
“I hope the Skeezicks, or the Pipsisewah
or the Skuddlemagoon hasn’t caught Mr.
Longears!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked in the dining room. The uncle
bunny had just come downstairs to his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ouch! Oh, me! Oh, my!” groaned Uncle
Wiggily as he sat down in his chair, which was
gnawed out of a grape vine root.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, no one is biting him,” said Nurse
Jane, as she looked all around. “Whatever in
the world is the matter, Wiggy?” she asked,
bringing in his breakfast turnip.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m getting old, I guess,” he answered.
“My joints are stiff, and it isn’t all rheumatism,
either. I can’t move around as spry as I’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>like to. Every time I bend over, or stoop, or
try to hurry I get aches and pains and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nonsense!” laughed Nurse Jane. “You
only imagine it. You’re as young as ever!
What you need is some one lively around the
house. Some one to chase you, to tag you and
make you spry. I can’t do it, because I have
the housework to look after. But if you could
get some bright, frisky, lively little chap—why,
you’d be a different rabbit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I s’pose I would,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Do you mean to get Johnnie or Billie Bushytail,
one of the squirrel boys? They’re lively
enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, they’re lively enough,” said Nurse
Jane, “but they have to frisk around their own
home nest. You want some one to stay here
with you a long time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” said Uncle Wiggily, sad like and
not very hopeful. “After breakfast I’ll go to
the five and six cent store and see if I can get
a lively little chap to cheer me up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You won’t find any at the five and six, nor
even at the ten and eleven cent store,” said
Nurse Jane. “True, the little mousie girl
clerks are lively enough, but they have to work.
You need a—well, a sort of companion. I’m
getting too old for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” scoffed Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>But, as he hopped over the fields and through
the woods after breakfast the more he thought
of what Nurse Jane had said the more he knew
she was right.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I need some one lively to make me jump
around,” thought the bunny. “If only I could
get a——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then he heard a little voice calling:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me out! Let me out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! Where does that voice come from?”
asked the bunny. “Where are you, whoever
you are?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In this hollow stump, right behind you!”
answered the voice. “Oh, I hate being cooped
up here! I want to get out and jump around
and chase my shadow and jump over moonbeams
and all things like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you—are you a fairy?” asked Uncle
Wiggily sort of hopeful like. “If I help you
out of the hollow stump, could you make me
feel younger and more lively?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I could; but I’m not a fairy,” was
the answer, given with a jolly laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must be a fairy or else you couldn’t
take away my old-age aches and pains,” said
the bunny. “Well, as long as you aren’t the
skillery-scalery alligator, or the Pipsisewah, I’ll
let you out. But how did you get in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me out and I’ll tell you,” said the voice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The hollow stump was partly filled with old
dried leaves, broken sticks and bits of bark.
Uncle Wiggily scraped all this away with his
paws, and out popped the dearest little girl
rabbit you ever saw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, who are you?” asked Uncle Wiggily in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am Baby Bunty,” was the answer. “I
was going through the woods with my papa and
mamma a while ago, but a bad fox caught them,
and I was left all alone. So I hid in the hollow
stump, the birds piled leaves and bits of bark
over me to cover me, but when it rained it was
packed down so hard that I couldn’t get out.
So I had to cry for help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m glad I helped you,” said the
bunny. “But how are you going to make me
feel young again——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tag! You’re it!” suddenly cried Baby
Bunty, tapping Uncle Wiggily with her paw.
“Now you have to chase me!” and away she
hopped through the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness! If she goes along like that,
all alone, the fox will catch her!” said Uncle
Wiggily. “I’ll have to run after her! But
my aches—my pains—oh dear!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Away hopped the rabbit gentleman, after
Baby Bunty. She ran fast and so did Uncle
Wiggily, and when they reached his hollow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>stump bungalow he was so warm and excited
and so anxious about Baby Bunty—why, he
wasn’t lame or stiff a bit! Can you imagine?</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you so!” laughed Nurse Jane, when
she saw the baby rabbit, which Mr. Longears
said he would keep in his bungalow. “Now
that you have some one young around you’ll get
younger yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Mr. Longears did. And if the top of
the house doesn’t go down cellar to see why the
laundry tubs can’t wash the coal white, I’ll tell
you next about Uncle Wiggily and Bunty’s
skates.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY II<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S SKATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit
gentleman, was asleep in his hollow stump bungalow
one morning, when he heard, as if in a
dream, Nurse Jane Fuzzy ring the breakfast
bell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! Um! Ah! I don’t hardly believe I’ll
get up this morning!” said Uncle Wiggily, sort
of stretchy like. “You may keep breakfast for
me, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! You must get up!
You must get up! You must get up! Oh,
Uncle Wiggily, you must get up! You must
get up today! Right away!” sang a jolly little
voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily gave a sudden start. All his
aches and pains seemed to go away at once, and
he felt as spry as a new grasshopper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello! Who’s down there?” he called from
the top of the stairs, for the voice seemed to
come from the dining room, down below. “Who
wants me to get up?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s Baby Bunty!” said Nurse Jane. “Have
you forgotten that you brought her home from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>a hollow stump yesterday, and that she’s going
to live here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I did forget!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Is she still here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you’d better come down here and look
after her while I get breakfast!” said Nurse
Jane. “I never saw such a lively little rabbit
before! She nearly jumped over the milk bottle
while I had my back turned!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily smiled until his pink nose
twinkled on both sides at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So Baby Bunty is lively, is she?” said the
bunny gentleman. “Well, that’s just what I
need to keep me from getting old and stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hurry, Uncle Wiggily! Hurry!” called
Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the hurry?” asked Mr. Longears, as
he smoothed out his fur with a pine tree cone
for a brush.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, this is the first of May!” went on the
little rabbit girl, who was going to live with
Uncle Wiggily. “It’s the first of May and
we’re going out and gather flowers today,
tra-la!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s going?” asked Uncle Wiggily, as he
came downstairs to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and I are going to gather flowers.
We’ll have fun, many joyful hours!” sang Baby
Bunty, as she danced about the breakfast room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>like a sunbeam playing tag with a pussy cat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, oh! We’ll see about that!” said Uncle
Wiggily. “Now you run out and play while
I eat, and then we’ll see what happens. Did
you have your breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, Baby Bunty was up as soon as I
was,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily ate his breakfast slowly and
carefully. He didn’t like to hurry except when
the Pipsisewah was chasing him. And after he
had eaten some carrot pancakes, Uncle Wiggily
felt sort of lazy like and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll play a little trick on Baby Bunty,” he
thought. “I don’t believe it will do my old
bones good to go off in the damp woods so early
in the morning to gather flowers. I’ll wait
until the sun is warmer. I’ll just stay here and
go to sleep. She’ll forget all about me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily curled up in the easy
chair, thinking how good it felt to rest his tired
bones and joints. But, all of a sudden, as he
was sort of dozing off to sleep, he heard Nurse
Jane cry:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Come here! Come
quickly! There goes Baby Bunty off on her
skates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty? Going off on her skates!
Why, she hasn’t any skates!” cried the rabbit
gentleman, suddenly waking up! “She’s too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>little to have roller skates, and it isn’t the time
of year for ice skates. How you talk, Nurse
Jane!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there she goes, anyhow!” said the
muskrat lady. “She’s a lively little tyke, is
Baby Bunty. She made herself a pair of roller
skates out of some old round clothespins, and
there she goes on them, skating down the woodland
path. You’d better run after her, Uncle
Wiggily, or a bad fox may catch her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so!” cried Uncle Wiggily. Then he
forgot all about his stiff joints, and how he used
to have rheumatism and all that. Away he
hopped and ran and leaped and jumped after
Baby Bunty. And away the little Bunty went
on her clothespin roller skates.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried to him.
“See if you can catch me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, Uncle Wiggily finally did, but it was
hard work, and he was so out of breath when
he finally ran and caught up to Baby Bunty
that he could hardly twinkle his pink nose at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t this jolly!” laughed the little bunny
girl tyke. “Now we can get May flowers! I
wanted you to be lively and come, and you did.
You came right after me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but you led me quite a chase!” panted
Uncle Wiggily. “However, I guess I feel
better after it. I’m not stiff, now!” And he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>wasn’t a bit, and he and Baby Bunty gathered
a fine bouquet of May blossoms. And if the
molasses jug doesn’t get stuck in the alley when
it’s trying to run through and tag the sugar
cookie, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Bunty’s ride.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY III<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S RIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Out in front of the hollow stump bungalow
sat Uncle Wiggily’s automobile. He had put
on it a new turnip steering wheel, and he was
thinking of going for a ride, when Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy came out on the front stoop and
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s the pepper caster, Mr. Longears.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pepper caster? What do I want of that
when I’m going for a ride in my auto?” asked
the bunny, in surprise. “I don’t need it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, you do,” spoke Nurse Jane.
“Don’t you remember? You always sprinkle
pepper on the sausage tires of your auto, when
you want to go fast. And you might want to
go fast today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I might,” said Uncle Wiggily, reflective
like, and slow. “So I might. Thank you,
Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bunny rabbit gentleman took the pepper
caster from the muskrat lady, but still he did
not get in his auto and take a ride. Instead he
sat down on a bench in front of his bungalow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and he let the sun shine through his whiskers
and on his pink, twinkling nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think I’ll sit here and take a rest,” spoke
Uncle Wiggily. “I did have it in mind to go
for a ride, but it is very nice here. It does my
old rheumatic joints good to let the sun soak in.
I’ll just be lazy and comfortable like today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he took some soft cushions out of the
Sunday parlor part of his auto, made himself
a little bed on the bench at the sunny side of his
machine, and snuggled down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what a funny looking rabbit you are!”
cried a jolly little voice all of a sudden. “Come
on and play with me, Uncle Wiggily!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Baby Bunty! Not today!” answered
Mr. Longears, not even bothering to open his
eyes, he was so lazy like and self-contained.
But even if he did not see her, he knew it was
Baby Bunty speaking. She was the lively little
rabbit girl he had found in a hollow stump, and
had brought home to live with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, come and play tag!” begged Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! Nope! Nopey!” said Mr. Longears
slowly. “I just want to sit and rest. My
joints are too stiff to play tag!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then everything grew quiet and peaceful,
and Uncle Wiggily thought Baby Bunty had
gone away so he could go to sleep. Baby Bunty
had gone away, but in a very queer way.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>All of a sudden Uncle Wiggily was awakened
by hearing Nurse Jane call out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Oh, Uncle Wiggily!
Baby Bunty is having a ride.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is she?” asked the bunny slowly. “That’s
good! I hope she has a nice one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but listen!” cried the muskrat lady.
“Baby Bunty jumped in your auto while you
were asleep, and she sprinkled some pepper on
the bologna sausage tires, and now she’s riding
away! Run after her! Hop after her and
catch her in the auto, or she may be hurt!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my! Oh, my goodness!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. He was wide awake now, and he
forgot all about his stiff joints and wanting
to rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>On through the woods he hopped. Faster
and faster rode Baby Bunty in the runaway
auto. Faster and faster hopped Uncle
Wiggily. Quicker and quicker went Baby
Bunty in the skippily auto. Quicker and
quicker hopped Uncle Wiggily after her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop! Stop!” cried the rabbit gentleman.
“What are you trying to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I wanted to have some fun, and make
you chase me,” said Baby Bunty. “But I
didn’t mean to go so fast, and now I can’t stop!
Save me! Save me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will if I can!” panted Uncle Wiggily. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>wasn’t a bit lazy or sleepy now. Nor were his
joints stiff! He was as lively as a cricket.</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly, just as Baby Bunty, not knowing
much about automobiles, was going to run into
a tree, Uncle Wiggily gave a big skip and a
hop and caught up to her. In he jumped, shut
off the gasolene, put on the brakes and saved
Bunty. Then the little rabbit girl smiled
sweetly and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Uncle Wiggily. I thought I
could make you come and have a ride with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well—dont—do—it—again!” said the rabbit
gentleman, all out of breath like. “You are
getting too lively for me, Baby Bunty! Altogether
too lively!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Still he liked her, and if the can opener doesn’t
take the top off the powdered sugar basin and
make the goldfish sneeze, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and Bunty’s balloon.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY IV<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S BALLOON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Is she here?” whispered Uncle Wiggily to
his muskrat lady housekeeper, Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, as he hopped into his hollow
stump bungalow one day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck
lady, who was just here calling on me?” asked
Nurse Jane. “If you mean her, she has gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I mean Baby Bunty. Is she here?”
asked Uncle Wiggily, still whispering and looking
all around the bungalow, while he twinkled
his pink nose expectant like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty isn’t here,” said Nurse Jane.
“I gave her a penny a while ago and she said
she was going down to the one-cent store and
buy a toy balloon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Then I can come in and have a rest,”
said the rabbit gentleman. “Baby Bunty is
good to keep an old rabbit man’s joints from
getting stiff,” he said, as he stretched out in his
easy chair, “but too much of it is quite enough.
I’ll be glad of a little rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty, you know, was a cute little
rabbit girl, whose father and mother had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>taken away by a fox. Uncle Wiggily found
Baby Bunty in the woods in a hollow stump,
and brought her home with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s so lively she’ll keep you from getting
old and stiff,” said Nurse Jane. And Baby
Bunty was very lively like and always doing
something.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But now, since she has gone down the woodland
path to buy a toy balloon, I’ll sit here and
rest,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll take a nap
until it’s time to eat dinner.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily stretched out in his easy chair.
Soon his pink, twinkly nose was still and quiet.
Mr. Longears was asleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bunny rabbit gentleman was just dreaming
he was chasing Baby Bunty through the
woods in his automobile when, all of a sudden,
in came running Billie Wagtail, the goat boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily!”
bleated Billie. “You ought to see her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See whom?” asked Mr. Longears, waking up
so suddenly that his nose twinkled twice as fast
as it ought. “See whom?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty!” answered the goat boy.
“She’s away up in the air sailing over the treetops!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is?” cried the bunny gentleman. “Oh,
dear! Some more of her tricks to keep me from
getting old and stiff, I suppose. Did she take
my airship out, as she ran away in my auto
yesterday?” he asked Nurse Jane.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
<img src='images/p024.jpg' alt='[Airship]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“I think not,” answered the muskrat lady.
“Your airship is still in the stable. And are you
sure you saw her up above the trees, Billie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes’m! And here comes Johnnie Bushytail,
the squirrel! He saw her, too!” bleated the
goat boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter with Baby Bunty?” asked
Uncle Wiggily of the chattery chap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I don’t know,” answered Johnnie. “But
she’s sailing around just like an airship—over
the tops of the trees. Come out and see!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out rushed Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane
and Billie, the goat, and Johnnie, the squirrel.
Surely enough, up above their heads, was Baby
Bunty floating along like a cloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” cried Uncle Wiggily; “that little
rabbit girl is always doing something. But I
must chase after her! I must get her down!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quick, Nurse Jane. Bring out my flying
suit of leather! Billie, you and Johnnie run my
airship out of the barn! I’ll have to sail up in
my airship and bring down Baby Bunty, but I
don’t see how she got up there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily was soon seated on the sofa
cushions of his airship, which had toy circus balloons
to raise it up and an electric fan that went
whizzieizzie to speed it along. Soon he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>sailing over the tree tops, up near where Baby
Bunty was floating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! How did you ever get up here?”
asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I didn’t mean to! Really I didn’t!”
said Baby Bunty, half crying. “But I’m glad
you came after me, for it will keep you from
getting old and stiff!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I s’pose it will!” said Uncle Wiggily,
as he sailed close to the little bunny girl and
took her into the clothes basket part of his airship.
“Ah! Ha! I see how you came to rise
off the earth!” he said. “You blew your penny
toy balloon up so big that it swelled and raised
you up; didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Baby Bunty, “I did. But I
didn’t mean to. I just blew and blew into my
toy balloon and it got bigger and bigger, and
then I couldn’t get the air out, and the balloon
began to go up and I began to go up, and—well,
I’m glad you came and got me!” she
finished.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Uncle Wiggily, “I s’pose you are.
But don’t do it again.” Then he let the air out
of the toy balloon that Baby Bunty had blown
too big for herself, and Mr. Longears took the
little rabbit girl down to earth in his airship.
And everybody said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t Baby Bunty cute!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Yes,” said Mr. Longears, “she is. No one
would get stiff joints with her around.” And
if the box of talcum powder doesn’t blow smoke
in the eyes of the potatoes and make them blink,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
Bunty’s doll.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY V<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S DOLL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Bunty?” asked Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, one morning,
as he came down to breakfast in his hollow
stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Bunty has gone out to play, long ago!”
said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m glad of that,” spoke Uncle
Wiggily, with a sigh, sort of restful like and
ample. “It’s a good thing to have Bunty go
out and play.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean it’s good for her?” asked Nurse
Jane, as she sliced some carrots for the bunny’s
breakfast and poured maple sugar sauce over
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s restful for Bunty and restful for me,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “Do you know, Nurse
Jane,” he went on, “since I found Baby Bunty,
that cute little rabbit girl, in a hollow stump and
brought her home to live with us, she certainly
has kept me going. Yes, sir!” exclaimed Mr.
Longears, explosive like and inflammatory, at
the same time documentary, “she certainly has
kept me busy!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“But it’s good for you,” said Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper. “You
haven’t looked so well in months. Baby Bunty,
by being lively, and making you chase her every
once in a while, keeps you from getting stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, yes, perhaps,” admitted the bunny
rabbit. “But, at the same time I am glad she
has gone out to play this morning. Now, after
breakfast, I can sit and read my paper in peace
and restfulness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, when he had finished eating his turnip
turnovers, with lettuce frosting on, Uncle Wiggily
sat down in his easy chair in the sunshine,
and began to look over the Cabbage Leaf
Gazette, which is the newspaper of the animal
people of Woodland, near the Orange Ice
Mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>But just as Uncle Wiggily was reading how
Grandfather Goosey Gander had a cold in his
bill and couldn’t quack very well, Nurse Jane
suddenly cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Come here as quickly
as you can. Hurry!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter now?” asked the rabbit
gentleman, as he dropped his paper and gave
three hops, a jump and part of a skip to the
window, out of which Nurse Jane was looking.
“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See! There goes Baby Bunty’s doll!” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the muskrat lady. “It’s skidding along over the
ground as fast as the skillery-scalery alligator
can crawl. Baby Bunty’s doll is running away,
and she’ll feel so badly!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty’s doll running away? Impossible!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “The doll isn’t
alive—it can’t run away!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is!” said Nurse Jane. “See it skiddle
along!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, as true as I’m telling you, there was
Baby Bunty’s doll, moving along the woodland
path, over the green moss, over the green grass,
over the brown leaves in and out among the
green ferns. The doll was sliding along the
ground, but no one was dragging her or pulling
her or pushing her—that is as far as Uncle
Wiggily and Nurse Jane could see.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you ever? Can you imagine it!” cried
the muskrat lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see it!” said the bunny, rubbing his
eyes, and his pink, twinkling nose, to make sure
he was awake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can see it!” said Uncle Wiggily. “I don’t
have to imagine it. But what makes that doll
go I don’t know. Some dolls can walk and talk,
but I never saw one slide along all by herself
before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Run after it, quickly!” cried Nurse Jane.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Baby Bunty will feel very badly if her doll is
lost! Run after it for her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” said the rabbit gentleman. Not
stopping to put on his tall, silk hat, and forgetting
all about his red, white and blue striped
rheumatism crutch, out of his hollow stump
bungalow rushed Uncle Wiggily. After the
doll he hopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as fast as he hopped the doll skiddled
along just as fast, always keeping ahead of Mr.
Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ho! I’ll get you yet!” cried the bunny.
And he hopped faster and faster. But the doll
skiddled along even more quickly. Uncle
Wiggily was hopping as he had never hopped
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes that doll skiddle along?” panted
the bunny, all out of breath. “I cannot see any
one pulling or pushing her. It can’t be a trick
of the Pipsisewah or the Skuddlemagoon, for I
can see neither of those bad chaps. What
makes the doll move along? I must find out,
but first I must get hold of it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So the bunny hopped along faster and faster,
and the doll skiddled along until, all of a sudden,
Baby Bunty’s play-toy caught on a twisted
tree root, was held fast, and Uncle Wiggily,
making a big jump, grabbed it. Then he saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that a thin, black but very strong thread was
tied around the doll.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! Some one was pulling that doll along
by this black string, and I couldn’t see it,” said
the rabbit gentleman. “I wonder who did it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did!” cried a jolly voice, and out from
behind a bush jumped Baby Bunty. “I tied the
long thread to my doll, and then I hopped ahead
and pulled the doll after me!” said Baby Bunty.
“I wanted you to hop along fast, and not get
stiff, Uncle Wiggily, and you did! Ho! Ho!
Ha! Ha!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily rubbed his pink nose. He
shook his paw at Baby Bunty, but he couldn’t
help laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not stiff now,” he said, “but I may be
tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no you won’t!” laughed Baby Bunty!
And if the bath tub doesn’t sprinkle paregoric
perfume on the wash rag, thinking it’s a handkerchief,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Bunty’s medicine.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY VI<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S MEDICINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Baby Bunty! Baby Bunty!” called
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, to the little rabbit
girl, who had been found in a hollow stump by
Uncle Wiggily Longears. “Ho, Baby Bunty!
Come here, quickly!” called the muskrat lady
housekeeper of the rabbit’s bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does Uncle Wiggily want to play tag with
me, or hide-and-go-seek?” asked Baby Bunty,
as she came running in from the front yard.
She had been playing dolls with Susie Littletail,
the big rabbit girl, and with Lulu and Alice
Wibblewobble, the duck girls. “Does Uncle
Wiggily want to chase me?” asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed!” answered Nurse Jane. “You
are altogether too lively for Uncle Wiggily, I’m
afraid. He is so stiff and lame, from having
chased your doll yesterday, as you were pulling
it along through the wood by a string—Uncle
Wiggily is so lame from his fast hopping that
you’ll have to go get Dr. Possum.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What for?” asked Baby Bunty, who was,
indeed, a lively little rabbit girl, always wanting
the bunny gentleman to play with her and chase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>her. She said it kept him lively. Well, it did
to a certain extent. “Why does Unk Wig want
Dr. Possum?” asked Baby Bunty, giving Mr.
Longears one of his pet names.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because he is ill,” said Nurse Jane. “He
is so lame and stiff that he just sits in an easy
chair and grunts. Dr. Possum will come and
give Uncle Wiggily some medicine and then he’ll
be better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right! I’ll go!” said Baby Bunty, and
pretty soon she came riding back with the animal
doctor in his automobile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My! But you came quickly!” said Nurse
Jane, as Dr. Possum stopped his car amid a
shower of leaves, in front of Uncle Wiggily’s
hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I just had to!” said Dr. Possum, getting out
and curling his long tail around his satchel of
pink, blue, red, yellow and skilligimink colored
pills. “Baby Bunty said if I didn’t ride here
as fast as I could make the auto go, maybe
Uncle Wiggily would never get better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think it isn’t quite as bad as that,” said
Nurse Jane. “Still Uncle Wiggily is very lame
and stiff. He says he can’t move, from having
hopped too lively yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum! Anybody would be lively where
Baby Bunty was,” spoke Dr. Possum. “Now,
I’ll have a look at my Uncle Wiggily friend.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Well, Dr. Possum gave Mr. Longears red
pills and pink pills and yellow pills and brown
pills, but still, all that day, the rabbit gentleman
sat in his chair and grunted and groaned and
said he was so stiff he couldn’t move. Dr.
Possum shook his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t understand it,” he said. “There
doesn’t seem to be much the matter with Uncle
Wiggily, but yet he won’t get up and move
about. Suppose you make him some sassafras
tea,” he said to Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” she promised. So Dr. Possum
went away, and Nurse Jane went out in the
woods to dig up some sassafras roots, and Baby
Bunty was left home with Uncle Wiggily.
The rabbit gentleman sat in his easy chair, with
his eyes shut and his pink nose twinkled hardly
any.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you feel now?” asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, perhaps if I read the paper I’d feel
better,” said Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, if you’ll give me my glasses, my dear,”
went on Uncle Wiggily, “I’ll sit here and read
until Nurse Jane comes back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A queer look came over Baby Bunty’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where are your glasses?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On the mantel,” said the rabbit gentleman.
Baby Bunty looked.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“I don’t see them,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, maybe they’re on the clock shelf,” spoke
Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, they aren’t there,” said Baby Bunty.
“I guess you’ll have to get up and help me hunt
for them, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! I suppose I must,” groaned the
bunny. Slowly, and with much groaning, he
got out of his chair. He looked in several
places for his glasses so he could read. But he
could not find them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe they’re behind the piano,” said Baby
Bunty. Uncle Wiggily looked there, but no
glasses were to be found. “Maybe they’re over
here under the couch!” cried Baby Bunty, hopping
across the room. Uncle Wiggily followed
her. The glasses were not there. “Maybe
they’re out in the kitchen. Come on, run out
there with me and look,” cried Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily did. And then such a chase,
all over the hollow stump bungalow, as Baby
Bunty led Uncle Wiggily looking for his
glasses! Up stairs and down stairs he hopped,
getting more and more lively all the while.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, when Uncle Wiggily was trying to
jump up on top of the picture moulding, since
Baby Bunty said his glasses might be there, in
came Nurse Jane with the sassafras.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Why, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried. “What’s
the matter? You must be all better by the
lively way you hop about! What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m looking for my glasses, and Baby Bunty
is helping me,” answered Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, how forgetful you are, Wiggily!
There are your glasses, on top of your head,
where you so often put them!” said Nurse Jane.
“Didn’t you know they were there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Mr. Longears, “I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did—all the while!” laughed Baby Bunty.
“But I just wanted you to hop around lively
and hunt for them. You aren’t stiff now, are
you, Mr. Longears?” she asked, formal like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Uncle Wiggily, twinkling his pink
nose, “I am not at all stiff! Yours was the best
medicine, Baby Bunty!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And if the mince pie doesn’t dream that it’s
a trolley car and try to run a race with the rag
doll’s automobile, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Bunty’s picnic.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY VII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S PICNIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do today, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Baby Bunty, as she saw the
rabbit gentleman sitting in the sun on a bench
at the side of his hollow stump bungalow one
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I’m going to take a little hop through
the woods, and perhaps call on Grandfather
Goosey Gander, to see if he is well again, after
having had a cold in his bill,” spoke Mr.
Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Baby Bunty, the little
rabbit girl, who was hidden in a hollow stump
until Uncle Wiggily found her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” asked the rabbit gentleman.
“Didn’t I hop around enough to suit you
when I was looking for my glasses and they
were on top of my head all the while!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! you hopped enough, and you cured your
stiffness,” said Baby Bunty. “But if you are
going to the woods,” said the little tot, “can’t
you take me for a picnic? I haven’t had a
picnic in ever so long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ho! So you want a picnic!” laughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Uncle Wiggily. “Well, I guess we might have
one. Tell Nurse Jane to make some carrot
sandwiches, and some turnip flopovers, and a
few lettuce ice cream cones, and we’ll go in the
woods and have a picnic.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, goodie! Oh, joy!” cried Baby Bunty,
and she clapped her paws together and tried
to make her teeny weeny pink nose twinkle
as Uncle Wiggily made his. But, of course, it
wasn’t the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a little while Nurse Jane had put up a
nice lunch in a birch bark basket, and Uncle
Wiggily and Baby Bunty started to hop
through the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! there goes Billie Bushytail, the squirrel
boy, and his brother Johnnie is with him,” suddenly
called the baby rabbit after a while.
“May they come to our picnic?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely,” answered Uncle Wiggily. And
after that he and Baby Bunty saw Lulu, Jimmie
and Alice Wibblewobble, the ducks, and
Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog
boys, and Nannie and Billie Wagtail, the goats.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bring them all to our picnic!” invited Uncle
Wiggily. “We have lunch enough for all.”
So all the animal children went to Baby Bunty’s
picnic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under a tree, on a carpet of green moss, with
a fringe of ferns about it, and using toadstools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>for seats, the rabbit gentleman and Baby Bunty
and their friends started the picnic. They had
carrot sandwiches, lettuce cakes, turnip jump-arounds
and cabbage cookies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a jolly picnic!” said everybody.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you like it,” spoke Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, all of a sudden, Jackie Bow Wow
gave a soft little bark, and said to Baby Bunty:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look! Uncle Wiggily is going to sleep.
We can’t have any fun at this picnic if he goes
to sleep! He ought to play games with us,
make whistles from the willow tree and all
things like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said Baby Bunty, “so he ought. Oh,
dear! I wish Uncle Wiggily wouldn’t go to
sleep after he eats! But he almost always does,
of late, even at home. I guess he is getting old
and stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t you make him wake up and be more
lively?” asked Lulu Wibblewobble, as she helped
a little ant lady lift some carrot bread crumbs
over a fallen leaf.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try,” said Baby Bunty. “A picnic isn’t
any fun unless you play games. And if Uncle
Wiggily is going to sleep all the while we can’t
play games with him. Now just watch me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty slipped up behind Uncle Wiggily,
and, taking a long green fern leaf, she
softly tickled the bunny rabbit on one of his ears.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“A-ker-choo! Goo-zeesium!” suddenly sneezed
the bunny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! He’s waking up!” quacked Jimmie
the duck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” whispered Baby Bunty. Then she
tickled the rabbit gentleman on his other ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wa-hoo! Zoop! Zing!” gargled Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s getting real excited like!” barked
Peetie Bow Wow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a minute!” begged Baby Bunty, keeping
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she took a soft piece of grass and she
let it flicker gently over Uncle Wiggily’s pink
nose, which never twinkled when he was asleep.
All of a sudden the bunny rabbit gentleman
cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh zip! Doodle-de-oodle! Gurr! Wafty-zup!”
And he sneezed and opened his eyes and
sat up and said: “Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no!” answered Baby Bunty sweetly.
“We just want you to play some games with
us; that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Play games! Of course I’ll play games. I
always do at a picnic,” laughed the rabbit gentleman.
“I declare! I must have been asleep!”
he said. “And I dreamed that a ladybug
tickled me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no! Nothing like that! Can you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>imagine!” laughed Baby Bunty. And all the
other animal children laughed, too. Then
Uncle Wiggily played “Hop Over the Stump”
and all such fashion games with them, and they
had a fine time at the picnic. And if the pumpkin
pie doesn’t take the chocolate cake out in
the dark and lose it, so there aren’t any cookies
for the goldfish, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Bunty’s bouquet.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY VIII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S BOUQUET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Will you do me just a little favor, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Baby Bunty one day, as she
came home from school, and saw the dear old
rabbit gentleman sitting in the sun outside his
hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you a favor? Why, of course, I will,
Baby Bunty,” said Mr. Longears to the little
rabbit girl he had found in the woods. “But
I hope it is a favor that will not make me hop
around. I am a bit stiff from having gone on
the picnic with you yesterday. Though I had
a good time, after all,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you did,” said Baby Bunty. “This
favor is a very easy one. You can sit there and
do it. All I want you to do is to tell me what
kind of woodland flowers to pick for a bouquet
for the lady mouse teacher in the hollow stump
school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ho!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “So your
lady mouse teacher wants a bouquet, does she?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Baby Bunty. “She told
each one of us to bring wild flowers to school
tomorrow. Sammie and Susie Littletail, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, and Lulu and
Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble—they all know
where to look in the woods for the blossoms.
But I’m such a little rabbit girl I don’t know.
So if you’ll tell me about the flowers, I’ll go
pick them before supper, and have them ready
for tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Uncle Wiggily, slowly like and
disengaged, as he tilted back on his easy chair,
“there are red flowers and blue ones, and golden
yellow ones, and some of purple. They will
make a nice bouquet when you pick them. Now
run off in the woods, Baby Bunty, and pick
some flowers. Then you’ll have pretty posies
for your teacher.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily closed his eyes, gave his pink
nose a soft little twinkle and was dozing off
again into a little before-supper sleep. Baby
Bunty shook her little head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This will never do,” she thought. “Uncle
Wiggily will get old and stiff, and he’ll think
his rheumatism is worse and all things like that
if I let him keep so quiet. I must rouse him up.
I haven’t time to make him chase me, as I want
to gather flowers. What shall I do? Oh, I
know!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Softly Baby Bunty hopped off on her tippy
tip-paws. Into the woods, not far from the
hollow stump bungalow, she went, and there she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>saw some red flowers. She began to pick them,
looking back, now and then, through the trees
to where Uncle Wiggily was asleep against the
side of his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must rouse him up and make him more
lively!” thought Baby Bunty. Then, all of a
sudden, as she was picking pink flowers she
gave a little scream and cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Come quick! Here’s
a big snake after me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that! A snake! A snake after
Baby Bunty when she’s picking a flower bouquet
for teacher?” cried the rabbit gentleman,
suddenly waking up. “That must never be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Quickly he sprang from the bark bench on
which he had been sitting. Over to the edge
of the woods he ran, where Baby Bunty was
picking a bouquet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s the snake?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
all ready to kindly ask the crawly creature to
go away and not hurt the little rabbit girl.
“Where’s the snake?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There!” cried Baby Bunty, pointing to
something squirming on the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That? Why that is only an angle worm!”
said Uncle Wiggily with a laugh. “He won’t
hurt you, Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! Only an angle worm!” said the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>rabbit girl, innocent-like and dissembling.
“Why, I thought it was a snake!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The angle worm crawled away, laughing to
himself. Uncle Wiggily went back to sleep
and Baby Bunty went on picking her bouquet.
She glanced back to where Mr. Longears was
having a nap. Then Baby Bunty suddenly
cried again:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! There’s a big beast in
an aeroplane airship flying after me! Come
quick and drive him away! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A big beast in an airship!” exclaimed the
rabbit gentleman, suddenly waking up. “Oh,
ho! I’ll soon drive him away!” He ran to
Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There it is!” she said, pointing her paw to
something fluttering in the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That? Why, that’s only a dragon fly!” said
Uncle Wiggily. “He will never hurt you. All
he does is to eat mosquitoes.” And back the
bunny went to sleep, while the dragon fly flew
on, laughing to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pretty soon Baby Bunty, who now had some
red, white and blue flowers for her bouquet,
called:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! There’s a big, wild,
spotted leopard after me! Come quick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily jumped up so quickly from
his sleep that he upset the bark bench.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Where’s the spotted leopard?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There!” said Baby Bunty, pointing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That! Why, that’s only Billy No-Tail, the
spotted frog boy!” said Uncle Wiggily. “He
won’t hurt you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” said Baby Bunty softly, “I thought he
was a green and yellow spotted leopard. Well,
as long as I have roused you up so often, Uncle
Wiggily, don’t you think you’d better stay
awake now, and help me pick teacher’s bouquet?
It will keep you from getting stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose so,” said the rabbit gentleman,
sort of sighing resigned like. And as he helped
pick the flowers he heard Baby Bunty laugh
softly every now and then.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder,” thought Uncle Wiggily, “if she
knew, all the while, that it was only an angle
worm, a dragon fly and the frog boy? I
wonder?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so do I. And if the Thanksgiving
Fourth of July pinwheel doesn’t scratch the
baby’s rattle box and make it squeak like a tin
horn I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
Bunty’s hat.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY IX<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S HAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Once upon a time Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy
promised Baby Bunty, the little rabbit girl, who
lived with Uncle Wiggily, to take her down to
the fifteen and sixteen cent store to buy a new
hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>But at the last minute Nurse Jane had to go
over to help Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady,
make sugar cookies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll take Baby Bunty to the five and ten cent
store myself,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll help
her get a new hat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, joy!” cried Baby Bunty. “I love to go
shopping with you, Uncle Wiggily. Only we’ll
go to the nineteen and twenty cent store. They
have lovely hats there! Why, some have grass-colored
ribbons and one has real cabbage leaf
trimmings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will be fine!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“When you are hungry you can eat part of your
hat, Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’ll never do that!” said the little rabbit
girl, who had been found in a hollow stump.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Nurse Jane went over to Mrs. Wibblewobble’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and Uncle Wiggily started for the
three and four cent store—no, I’m wrong—it
was the nineteen and twenty. Baby Bunty
skipped on ahead, running two and fro, jumping
over bushes and snuggling down in clumps of
ferns, as though playing hide and seek. Uncle
Wiggily went more slowly and rheumatic like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you jump, as I do?” asked Baby
Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my joints are too stiff,” said the bunny
rabbit. “I’m getting old, Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then I’ll have to make you lively!”
cried the little rabbit girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, please don’t do any more of your tricks!”
begged Uncle Wiggily with a laugh. “Just let
me hobble along in peace and quietness on my
rheumatism crutch. And, Baby Bunty, there is
one favor I want to beg of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” asked the little rabbit girl as
she waved her paw to a spotted lady bug,
friendly like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t ask me to go in that eleven and twelve
cent store with you to get your new hat,” spoke
the bunny. “I’ll go as far as the door with you
and give you the money. But I’ll wait outside.
I never can bear to hop up and down the aisles,
from the soap department over to the lace veil
counter doing shopping. I’ll wait for you outside.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Very well,” said Baby Bunty. “But I think
it would do your stiffness good to come in.
However, we shall see.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily hopped on with the lively
little rabbit girl, and soon they were at the—nineteen
and twenty cent store, I think. You
can look back and make sure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, I’ll wait here for you,” said the rabbit
gentleman, sitting down in a sunny place outside.
“Take the money and get a new hat
Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter with your pa? Isn’t he
feeling well?” asked a little mousie girl clerk,
as she came up to wait on Baby Bunty, and saw
the rabbit gentleman staying outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That isn’t my pa—it’s Uncle Wiggily,” said
the little shopper. “He’s getting stiff, but I’ll
soon make him feel better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she began to shop around and look at
hats, and pretty soon, having tried on one with
carrot trimmings, she went to the door and
called:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Wiggily! Please come in and see if
this looks well on me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my!” groaned Uncle Wiggily. “Must
I come in? Well, only this once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Slowly he hopped in, looked at Bunty’s hat,
and said:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
<img src='images/p050.jpg' alt='[Uncle Wiggily]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Oh, yes. That’s fine. Have it wrapped up
and we’ll get home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but there’s a hat with real radishes on,
up on the next floor!” said the little rabbit girl,
as she laid aside the carrot hat. “Let’s go look
at that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Up the stairs she hopped and Uncle Wiggily
had to hop after, groaning at his aching joints.
Baby Bunty tried on the radish hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s fine!” said Uncle Wiggily. “Buy it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but there’s one on the next floor with a
cabbage leaf crown. I want you to see how I
look in that!” said Baby Bunty. Up the stairs
she hopped and Uncle Wiggily hopped after
her. She tried on the cabbage hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Buy it! Oh, buy it!” begged the bunny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but on the next floor is a hat with
cucumber salad all around the edges!” said
Bunty. “I might look better in that!” Up
the stairs she hopped and Uncle Wiggily hopped
after her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, sir, Baby Bunty tried on forty-’leven
hats before she found one she liked, and by that
time Uncle Wiggily was so lively, from hopping
up and down stairs, that he felt real reckless like
and sporty, and he bought two ice cream cones.
He said he felt so good he had to have a treat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you’d like to come shopping!” said
Baby Bunty. And Uncle Wiggily only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>twinkled his pink nose. But if the molasses jug
doesn’t take the candy stick to beat the parlor
rug when it’s trying to race with the kitchen
oilcloth, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Bunty’s shoes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY X<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S SHOES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Wiggily, I am sorry to trouble you,”
said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper to the bunny rabbit gentleman
one day, “but do you think you could go to the
store for me? Or are you too stiff? Is your
rheumatism too bad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily looked all around the hollow
stump bungalow before answering. Then he
asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Baby Bunty here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not just now,” replied Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy,
trying not to smile. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because if I say I’m too stiff and old to go
to the store for you she’ll say I’m not too stiff
to play tag with her. And I certainly am!” said
Uncle Wiggily, positive like and semi-emphatic.
“I don’t want to move about quickly at all today.
I just want to go slow and easy like.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you may,” said Nurse Jane. “I only
want you to go to the store for me and get Baby
Bunty’s shoes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” cried Mr. Longears, and he
gave such a jump that his pink nose stopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>twinkling. “I thought you said you wanted me
to go to the store for <i>you</i>, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I do. I’d have to go after Bunty’s shoes
if you didn’t, and, really, I haven’t time. But
you don’t have to take Baby Bunty, so you may
hop as slowly as you like. I took her down and
she tried on the shoes yesterday. I left them
to be stretched. All you have to do is to bring
them home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I like Baby Bunty, and all that, but when I
want to hop slowly she wants to play tag and
the like of such nonsense. I’ll go to the store
alone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Away he started, leaning on his red, white and
blue striped rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane
had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk. And
Uncle Wiggily had not hopped very far before
he heard a voice calling:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Wait for me! Wait
a minute!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness me, sakes alive and some peanut
hash!” thought the bunny rabbit. “I hope
that isn’t the Pipsisewah or the Skuddlemagoon
after me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was just going to hide behind a tree when
he saw that it was Baby Bunty who was hopping
along through the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait a minute, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Well, something is surely going to happen
now,” thought the bunny rabbit.</p>

<p class='c008'>It did not take long for Baby Bunty to catch
up to Mr. Longears, for she was a lively little
rabbit girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” she gasped. “I know
where you are going! You are going after my
new shoes. I heard Nurse Jane tell you! I
was playing tag down behind the rain water
barrel. I didn’t mean to listen, but I couldn’t
help hearing. Please take me with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Well, what could Uncle Wiggily do? He
didn’t want to hurt Baby Bunty’s feelings, and
he certainly was going after her shoes. So he
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, look here, Baby Bunty! No tricks,
you know! No making me hop up and down
stairs to look at you try on new hats, you know!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not!” laughed the little rabbit girl.
“Besides, we are going after shoes today, and
I don’t have to try them on. Nurse Jane helped
me buy them yesterday. I’ll be good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And please be quiet—don’t make me do any
extra hopping today!” begged the bunny rabbit
gentleman. “My joints are too stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty had a funny little twinkle in her
eyes as she hopped along with Mr. Longears.
Soon they were at the shoe store and a nice rat
gentleman handed Mr. Longears a neat package.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Well, this isn’t so bad,” thought the bunny
rabbit. “There’s to be no trying on, and, in
consequence, there can be no hopping up and
down stairs.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With the shoe package under one leg, and
holding Bunty’s paw in his other one, Uncle
Wiggily started back for the hollow stump
bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t we go any faster than this?” asked
Baby Bunty. “I want to hurry home and wear
my new shoes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, this is fast enough for my rheumatic
joints,” spoke the rabbit gentleman, contented
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty started to run backward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why—why—where are you going?” asked
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think the man forgot to put any laces
in my new shoes!” cried Baby Bunty. “I must
run back and get them. You wait for me,
Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I can’t wait,” said Mr. Longears. “I
must go with you, to see that you don’t get lost!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Back ran Baby Bunty and back ran Uncle
Wiggily. And when they reached the shoe
store the rat gentleman said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, the lacers are in the shoes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how silly of me!” said Baby Bunty.
“So they are! Now we must hop along fast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Uncle Wiggily, or it will be dark before we get
home!” So, whether he liked it or not, Uncle
Wiggily had to hop along very fast, and so did
Baby Bunty. But it’s a good thing they did,
for, when they were almost at the hollow stump
bungalow, out popped the bad Pipsisewah, trying
to get the new shoes.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, only that Uncle Wiggily and Baby
Bunty were hopping so fast, the Pip might have
caught them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he didn’t, I am glad to say, and when
Baby Bunty reached home and tried on her new
shoes they fitted perfectly, and Uncle Wiggily
wasn’t hardly stiff at all. And if the lawn
mower doesn’t try to cut a slice off the cake of
soap for the goldfish to take a bath, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and Bunty’s hair
ribbon.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XI<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S RIBBON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Once upon a time Baby Bunty, the little rabbit
girl, who was hidden in a hollow stump until
she was found, said to Uncle Wiggily:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you come with me for a walk in the
woods today?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, Baby Bunty, I think I will,”
answered Mr. Longears. “But I am a bit stiff,
and my rheumatism hurts a little, so please don’t
ask me to chase you or do anything exciting like
that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” promised Baby Bunty, but, as she
tied her red sky-blue pink hair ribbon around her
neck, the little rabbit girl smiled in a queer way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she said to herself, as Uncle Wiggily
took his red, white and blue striped rheumatism
crutch down off the fence post, “I won’t make
him chase me, but I’ll keep him from going to
sleep. He’s a dear old rabbit gentleman, but he’s
getting old—or he thinks he is. I must keep him
lively!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty hopped
off through the woods. Nurse Jane Fuzzy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Wuzzy stood in the doorway of the hollow stump
bungalow and watched them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My! Baby Bunty has on her best hair ribbon
today,” said the muskrat lady housekeeper. “I
hope nothing happens to it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As Baby Bunty hopped along, now running
ahead of Uncle Wiggily and now lagging behind
to pick a pretty flower, all of a sudden her green
yellow brown hair ribbon caught on a bush and
the bow was untied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Please tie my hair ribbon!”
cried Baby Bunty with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily leaned on his red white and
blue striped rheumatism crutch, and, with his
paws, tied Baby Bunty’s ribbon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There!” he said, as he patted down the big
bow, which looked like the wings of a butterfly,
“I hope your hair ribbon doesn’t come untied
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope so, too,” said Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>On and on she hopped through the woods with
Uncle Wiggily. They were looking for a nice
place for the little rabbit girl to play. All of a
sudden, as she was peeping down in a robin’s
nest, to see how big the little birds were, her hair
ribbon caught on a branch of a tree, and loose
the bow came again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Will you please tie my
hair ribbon?” cried Baby Bunty with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Dear me!” said Uncle Wiggily. “That’s a
very loose ribbon, Baby Bunty! I ought to have
brought some glue to make the bow stay tied
fast.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But he fixed it for the little rabbit girl, and
on they hopped again. Pretty soon they came
to a beautiful place in the woods. On the ground
was a soft velvet carpet of green grass. Around
it was a fringe of ferns. Overhead was a big
umbrella of trees, which kept off the hot sun.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here is a good place for you to play, Baby
Bunty,” said Uncle Wiggily. “You may gather
flowers, hop on the grass or even turn somersaults.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what are you going to do, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked the little rabbit girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I shall go to sleep,” said the old gentleman
rabbit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty wrinkled up her nose in a funny
little way, but she didn’t say anything—just
then. Uncle Wiggily found a soft stump for a
seat, with a soft mossy covered tree for a back
rest, and there he sat down. Pretty soon his eyes
closed, his pink nose stopped twinkling, and he
was asleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” said Baby Bunty. “This isn’t any
fun—to have him go to sleep! Ah, I know what
I’ll do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She played around a little, turning peppersaults
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and somersaults, and, all at once, she gave
her hair ribbon a little pull.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried, running up
to the rabbit gentleman. “My ribbon is untied
again! Please fix it for me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily opened his eyes and grunted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems to me your hair ribbon is always
coming untied,” he said. But he made a nice
fancy bow for Baby Bunty, and then he went to
sleep again, while she played about. But, pretty
soon back she hopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What!” exclaimed the old rabbit gentleman.
“Is your hair ribbon loose again? Am I never
to get any sleep?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t my hair ribbon this time,” said Baby
Bunty. “But I saw a big fox sneaking along in
the bushes behind you, and I thought he might
bite some souse off your ears, so I woke you up!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you did!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“And you awakened me just in time, too. Now
we can run away before the fox gets us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And run away they did, and the old fox didn’t
get them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I would have had a nice lot of souse off
Uncle Wiggily’s ears, if Baby Bunty hadn’t
awakened him,” said the fox, hungry like.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, if the green grass doesn’t turn pink when
the red rose leaves fall on it, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and Bunty’s ball.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S BALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Will you come for another nice walk in the
woods, today, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Baby
Bunty, the little rabbit girl, as she danced around
the hollow stump bungalow where she lived with
Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum! Another nice walk in the woods, eh?”
asked Uncle Wiggily, suspicious like and premeditated.
“Are you going to wear a big hair
ribbon bow, that comes untied all the while?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no!” laughed Baby Bunty. “I’ll only
wear a tiny bow today. I won’t keep waking you
up all the time to tie it for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That’s what Baby Bunty did in the story
before this, if you will kindly remember. But,
after all, it was a good thing she did. On account
of the fox, you know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, come along!” said Uncle Wiggily,
after he had asked his muskrat lady housekeeper,
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, what they were
going to have for dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May I bring my rubber ball?” asked Baby
Bunty, as she came out of the hollow stump
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>bungalow with a very small pumpkin-colored
hair ribbon around her ears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, bring your ball along,” said Uncle
Wiggily kindly. “But please don’t sprinkle any
water from it on me while I’m asleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” promised Baby Bunty. And then,
as Uncle Wiggily hopped along on his red, white
and blue striped rheumatism crutch, and as Baby
Bunty ran along beside him, the little rabbit girl
said: “Oh, dear! If he’s going to sleep every
time we come to the woods, I’ll have no fun at
all. But maybe I’ll find a way to keep him
awake,” she said to herself, as she bounced her
rubber ball.</p>

<p class='c008'>On they went through the green woods, Baby
Bunty running to and fro as fast as an automobile,
and Uncle Wiggily coming along more
like a trolley car, substantial-like, though unpoetical.
The little rabbit girl picked pretty flowers
now and then, while Mr. Longears chewed
a bit of birch bark, or nibbled at sassafras and
wintergreen, hoping it would cure his rheumatism.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now here is a nice place for you to play,
Baby Bunty,” said Uncle Wiggily when they
reached a green glade in the forest. “And I’ll
just sit down on this soft, mossy log and think
a bit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know what that means!” whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Baby Bunty to herself. “It means he’ll go to
sleep and won’t play tag or anything with me,
and I can’t have any fun! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She bounced her ball on a bare, sandy place,
while Uncle Wiggily picked out the softest,
green, mossy log he could find. He laid aside
his rheumatism crutch, took off his tall silk hat,
and, folding his paws over his red vest, closed
his eyes. His pink nose stopped twinkling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s asleep!” said Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>All of a sudden her bouncing rubber ball gave
a big jump, and before the little rabbit girl could
get her paws on it the rubber ball bounded right
over on Uncle Wiggily’s bare head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I say! A-ker-choo! What’s that?” he
cried, waking up all at once, and not partly, as
he did sometimes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is only my rubber ball!” said Bunty
sweetly. “I’m so sorry it struck you! But, now
that you are awake, don’t you want to play tag
with me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not now,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I will later.
I haven’t had my nap out yet. Please be careful
of your ball, Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” said the little rabbit girl with a smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily closed his eyes again, and he
was just slumbering nicely, when, just as Baby
Bunty gave her rubber ball an extra hard bounce,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>away it flew again, and this time it landed right
on the rabbit gentleman’s pink nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness me, sakes alive and some rice
pudding without any raisins in!” he cried.
“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only my rubber ball,” said Bunty, sweetly.
“I’m sorry it awakened you. Don’t you want
to——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to finish my nap,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Please go away far off and bounce your
ball, Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more he went to sleep. Baby Bunty,
with a funny look on her face, hopped off in the
woods. Then, all of a sudden, through the trees
came flying her rubber ball. Straight as an arrow
it flew, and it struck Uncle Wiggily right on his
red vest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my goodness me, sakes alive and some
peanut lollypops!” he cried. “Is that your ball
again, Bunty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” said the little rabbit girl, “it is. I was
trying to throw it so Bully No-Tail, the frog boy,
could toss it back to me. But I guess I didn’t
throw straight enough. I’m sorry my ball hit
you, Uncle Wiggily, but, now that you are
awake, don’t you want to——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I’ll play tag or hide-and-go seek or
even turn somersaults!” laughed the bunny.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Between you and your ball, Baby Bunty, I’ll
never get any sleep!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you wouldn’t,” said Baby Bunty,
smiling in a funny way. Then she and Mr.
Longears had lots of fun. And, if the sunshine
doesn’t tickle the raindrops and make them fall
on the umbrella plant, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and Bunty’s carriage.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XIII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S CARRIAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, Uncle Wiggily,” called
a jolly voice one day outside the hollow stump
bungalow, where Mr. Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
lived with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
the muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! I wonder if that’s Sammie or Susie Littletail,
or Johnnie or Billie Bushytail?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, as he turned a leaf of the cabbage
newspaper he was reading.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s Baby Bunty,” said Nurse Jane. “I
guess she wants you to take her for a ride in
her little red carriage. I see she has it out in
front.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I can’t play with Baby Bunty today!”
said Uncle Wiggily quickly. “I must go over
and call on Grandfather Goosey Gander.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty will be so disappointed,” spoke
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too bad,” agreed Mr. Longears. “But I
must have a little rest and quiet. Baby Bunty
is so lively!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, she keeps you that way, too,” said the
muskrat lady. “And, on the whole, perhaps it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>is a good thing for you. I believe you have
become younger these last two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum!” said Uncle Wiggily, noncommital
like and unconvinced. “Anyhow I can’t play
with Baby Bunty this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And when he told this to the little rabbit girl,
whom he had found in a hollow stump, she said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! Then I’ll have to go off in the
woods by myself and pick wild flowers. But will
you play with me some other time, Uncle Wiggily,
and chase me and have a game of tag and
all that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” promised Uncle Wiggily, as he put on
his tall silk hat, and looked to see if his pink
nose was twinkling properly, “I’ll play with you
later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he went one way through the woods, and
Baby Bunty went another, pushing her carriage,
in which she often used to be wheeled when she
was smaller than she was now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t get lost!” said Uncle Wiggily, as he
waved his paw to the little rabbit girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll try not to,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily had a nice visit with his old
friend, Grandfather Goosey Gander. They
talked about the time when they were young
and spry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I’m getting old and stiff now,” said
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“You need some one to keep you lively,”
quacked Grandpa Goosey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I have some one!” laughed Mr. Longears.
“You should see Baby Bunty! Say, now
I think of it, come on back to my hollow stump
bungalow and stay to lunch. I’ll show you Baby
Bunty—if she’s home. But she’s nearly always
out in the woods, hopping around. She started
off with her carriage just before I came here.
Perhaps she went to get some one to give her
a ride, as I had no time. Come and see Baby
Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will!” promised Grandfather Goosey
Gander.</p>

<p class='c008'>Together he and Uncle Wiggily went through
the woods. But they had not traveled very far
before, all at once, Grandpa Goosey cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look there, Uncle Wiggily! What’s that
rolling down the hill in front of us? It looks
like a baby carriage!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is!” cried Mr. Longears, as he peered
through his spectacles. “It’s Baby Bunty’s carriage,
and it’s running away down hill. Oh, she’ll
be hurt! I must hop after that carriage and
stop it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You never can catch that carriage!” quacked
Grandpa Goosey. “It’s rolling down hill too
fast! You are so old and stiff, like myself——”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Am I old and stiff?” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“You just watch me hop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He jammed his tall silk hat down on his head,
took a tight hold of his red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch, and down the hill
he leaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Faster and faster rolled Baby Bunty’s carriage!
Faster and faster hopped Uncle Wiggily,
his coat tails streaming out behind like two
girls’s hair ribbons.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll save you, Bunty! I’ll save you!” cried
the rabbit gentleman. “Don’t jump out of the
carriage. I’ll get you! I can hop fast, even if
I am stiff!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With one big, extra long hop he reached the
carriage, and caught hold of it in his paws just
as it was going to tip over. He looked inside,
thinking to see Baby Bunty half frightened out
of her eye teeth, but, instead, there was only a
big bouquet of wild flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well! Well! What does this mean?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, all out of breath, but still not
stiff any more. “What is all this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Baby Bunty,
from the top of the hill, where she stood with
Grandpa Goosey, “did you think I was in that
runaway carriage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I certainly did!” answered Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I wasn’t at all!” laughed Baby Bunty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“I just used it to hold the wild flowers I picked.
And when I wheeled it to the top of the hill it
slipped away from me, and ran down. My! But
you did run fast, Uncle Wiggily!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say he did!” quacked Granda
Goosey. “Faster than I ever saw him hop
before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it’s good for his rheumatism,” spoke
Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Longears never said a word as he wheeled
the carriage up hill. But if the ice cream doesn’t
melt when the gas stove asks it to dance the fox
trot, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
Bunty’s party.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XIV<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S PARTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“My goodness me, sakes alive, Nurse Jane!”
cried Uncle Wiggily Longears one morning, as
he came downstairs in his hollow stump bungalow.
“Why are you making so many cakes, pies
and jam tarts? You have enough for a picnic!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are for Baby Bunty!” explained the
muskrat lady housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! Is she going to eat all those?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, surprised-like, not to say disconcerted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m going to let her have a play party
in the yard,” explained Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.
“Baby Bunty has been a good little girl lately,
and when she asked me if she couldn’t have a
party, with real cakes and cookies, I said yes.
I hope you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, not at all. Not at all!” quickly cried
Uncle Wiggily. “If Baby Bunty has a party
she won’t want me to chase her, or play tag, or
go off to the woods to keep young and from getting
stiff. If she has a party I can have a good
sleep and rest.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
<img src='images/p072.jpg' alt='[Uncle Wiggily]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“But you’ll come to her party a little while,
won’t you?” asked Nurse Jane. “Just look in
to be polite, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes,” answered the rabbit gentleman.
“I’ll just drop in for a cup of tea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty was delighted to have a party.
She danced around the hollow stump bungalow
and put on her best green yellow pink hair ribbon,
making Uncle Wiggily tie it for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a dear, good, old Uncle Wiggily,”
said Baby Bunty. “You’ll come to my party,
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but I just want to sit on a soft stump
and watch you and the other animal children
play,” spoke Mr. Longears. “I’m getting too
old and stiff for parties!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll see about that!” spoke Baby Bunty,
with a funny little laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurse Jane made the jam tarts, she frosted
the cakes and she put fancy trimmings on the
cookies and pies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now everything is ready for your party!”
said the muskrat lady to Baby Bunty. “Have
you invited all your friends?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and Uncle Wiggily, too,” said the little
rabbit girl, who was once found asleep in a hollow
stump.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little party tables were set out under the
grape vine, in the shade. Pretty soon along came
Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbits; Johnnie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels; Lulu,
Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble, the ducks, and
many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, everybody sit down!” invited Baby
Bunty, when they had gathered around the
tables, filled with good things. “Welcome to my
party! Uncle Wiggily, will you sing a little
song?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily, who wore his newest red vest,
looked surprised. But still he sang a song about
once there was a carrot with a long and slender
tail, and when it went out walking it swam in
the water pail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, everybody begin to eat!” invited Baby
Bunty. “Oh, isn’t it fun to have a party! Uncle
Wiggily, please pass Jackie Bow Wow a puppy
cake!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily, who had picked out a nice
shady corner, and was just closing his eyes,
opened them again, and passed the little doggie
boy a cake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll just sit here quietly,” thought Uncle
Wiggily to himself. “Pretty soon they’ll all be
so busy eating that they won’t notice me. Then
I can go to sleep and forget about my rheumatism.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The animal children were laughing and talking,
and also eating the good things. Uncle Wiggily’s
eyes were closed. He was dreaming he and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Grandpa Goosey Gander were playing Scotch
checkers, when, all of a sudden, Baby Bunty
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Wiggily, please pass Nannie Wagtail
some paste pudding!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh! What’s that? Oh, I guess I had my eyes
shut!” said the bunny gentleman. But he passed
the paste pudding to the little goat girl, and he
was just going to sleep again, when Bunty said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Do try some of these
turnip jam tarts! They’re wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes. Jam tarts!” stammered the rabbit
gentleman, awakening suddenly. However, he
managed to eat a tart, and he was almost asleep
again when Bunty suddenly said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, will you please pass the
rose leaf ice cream to Arabella Chick!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, certainly,” said Uncle Wiggily, and
he wondered if he would ever get a nice, quiet
nap, such as he had counted on. After he had
passed Lulu Wibblewobble some corn meal puddin’,
the rabbit gentleman dozed off again, but
he was suddenly awakened when Baby Bunty
cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, here they are! Here they come! Oh,
look, everybody!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness me, sakes alive and some fire
engines!” cried Mr. Longears, waking up so
suddenly that he spilled some carrot marmalade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>on his red vest. “What’s the matter, Baby
Bunty? Is it the Pipsisewah and the Skuddlemagoon
come to spoil your party?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, no,” answered the little rabbit girl,
sweetly. “It’s just the grasshopper and the
cricket musicians, who are coming to play for
the dancing. May I have a one-step with you,
Uncle Wiggily?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Baby Bunty!” laughed Mr. Longears,
as the grasshoppers tuned their hind-leg fiddles.
“No one could go to sleep at your party!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor grow old or stiff, either,” said Baby
Bunty. Then they all had a fine time. And if
the jumping Jack doesn’t fall out of the salt
cellar and scare the coal man when he brings in
the ice, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Bunty’s skipping rope.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XV<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S ROPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Uncle Wiggily, would you do me a little
favor?” asked Baby Bunty one morning, as she
came out on the porch of the hollow stump bungalow,
where Mr. Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
was reading the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Baby Bunty!” said Uncle Wiggily, to
the little rabbit girl, whom he had found in a
hollow stump tree, “I’d do almost anything for
you, but please don’t ask me to come to any
more parties, or chase you or play tag, or take
you out in the woods with your rubber ball. I
simply can’t do that, for I am too old and stiff!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, this isn’t anything like that. All I want
is for you to come with me while I buy a skipping
rope. I want to learn to jump. All the
other animal girls jump salt and pepper and
vinegar and mustard, and I, too, want to learn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Uncle Wiggily, slowly, “that
sounds like an easy favor. I’ll come, Baby
Bunty.” “She surely can’t make me jump rope,”
said Mr. Longears to himself. “I’m safe this
time. I’ll get a chance to sleep today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So, putting on his tall silk hat, and taking his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>red, white and blue striped rheumatism crutch
with him, Uncle Wiggily hopped with Baby
Bunty through the woods, to the ten and eleven
cent store where wild grape vine jumping, or
skipping, ropes were sold.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give Baby Bunty a nice rope,” said Uncle
Wiggily to the little mousie girl clerk behind the
counter, and the little rabbit girl soon had the
finest one you can imagine, with puff balls on
the ends so her paws wouldn’t slip off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I must learn to jump,” said Baby
Bunty, as she and Uncle Wiggily started back
through the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty had watched Lulu and Alice
Wibblewobble, the ducks, and some of the other
animal girls skipping their wild grape vine
ropes, so the little rabbit girl knew something
about it. She swung the rope over her head and
jumped “salt,” which is very slow jumping
indeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And while you are learning to skip rope,
Baby Bunty,” said Uncle Wiggily, “I’ll just
sit down on this soft green mossy log and go to
sleep. You won’t mind, will you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” answered Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found a nice, smooth place in the woods,
where the green grass made a velvet carpet, and
there Baby Bunty began to learn to jump.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Uncle Wiggily’s pink nose stopped twinkling,
and he fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” said Baby Bunty, after a bit, “I
never can learn all by myself. I’m going to tie
one end of my grape vine rope to a tree, and
ask Uncle Wiggily to turn the other end for me.
Then I can learn to jump and, after a while,
I’ll be able to turn for myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Gently she tickled Uncle Wiggily under the
chin with a soft piece of grass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh! What’s the matter? Mosquitoes?” cried
the bunny gentleman, as he sat up suddenly and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” answered Baby Bunty. “I’m sorry
to wake you up, Uncle Wiggily, but will you
please turn rope for me? Just turn it salt, which
is very slowly, and perhaps you can do that and
sleep at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps!” said Uncle Wiggily, but rather
doubtful like. “We’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he took one end of the grape vine rope,
while the other end was tied to a tree, and Uncle
Wiggily turned for Baby Bunty. He turned
slowly, as one must for “salt,” and Uncle Wiggily’s
eyes were just closing, and he was dozing
off, when Baby Bunty said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, could you please turn a little faster,
Uncle Wiggily? I’m beginning to learn how.
Please turn as fast as pepper.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“All right,” said Mr. Longears, good-natured
like and accommodating. So he turned faster—like
pepper you know—and even at that he was
soon falling asleep again, when Bunty cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m doing fine, Uncle Wiggily! I can
even jump as fast as vinegar now, if you’ll turn
more quickly for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll turn faster,” said Mr. Longears.
“But I can plainly see that I’ll get no sleep
today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he turned “vinegar,” and Bunty jumped
it easily, for she was fast learning how. Even
then Uncle Wiggily nodded, and was almost
going to sleep, when Bunty cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Please turn mustard!
Turn mustard fashion as fast as you can! Wake
up and turn mustard!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s this! Can you so soon jump as fast
as mustard?” cried the bunny, sitting up and
rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I can’t jump mustard yet!” cried
Bunty. “But I had to say something to wake
you up quickly. Look, here comes the bad Pipsisewah!
We must run! Run as fast as you can!
Run mustard fashion!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will!” said Uncle Wiggily, and he did, and
so did Bunty, and by running mustard, which is
very fast, they soon got safely away from the
bad Pipsisewah.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Hum!” said the Pip, as he was left behind in
the woods. “If it hadn’t been for Baby Bunty
waking up Uncle Wiggily, I surely would have
had his souse!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So it’s a good thing the little rabbit girl learned
how to skip her grape vine rope, isn’t it? And
the next day she could jump mustard. And if
the automobile doesn’t go swimming in with the
gold fish and make the poll parrot sleep in the
cat’s cradle, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Bunty’s scooter.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XVI<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S SCOOTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One day, when Uncle Wiggily Longears, the
bunny rabbit gentleman, came home to his hollow
stump bungalow, having been over to call
on Grandpa Goosey Gander, Mr. Longears saw
Baby Bunty sitting on the front steps looking
very sad and sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Did you lose your grape vine skipping rope,
Baby Bunty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” answered the little rabbit girl. “My
rope is all right, and I can jump salt, pepper,
vinegar, mustard and even rice pudding. But I
want a scooter, Uncle Wiggily! I want a scooter
very much!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A scooter!” cried the bunny rabbit gentleman,
in surprise. “What is that? Something
new to jump rope with?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no,” answered Baby Bunty with a smile.
“A scooter is a little two-wheeler roller skate
wagon. It has wheels on it, and a place for you
to stand with your feet and a place to hold on
by your paws. You get on the scooter, give yourself
a little push, and away you scoot as fast as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>anything! I want a scooter, Uncle Wiggily. All
the other animal boys and girls have ’em!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you shall have one, too!” cried Mr.
Longears. “Come on, Baby Bunty, we’ll go
down to the fifteen and sixteen cent store and
get you a scooter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, joy!” said Baby Bunty, clapping her
paws, and trying to make her pink nose twinkle
like Uncle Wiggily’s. But she didn’t do it very
well, being so small.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later the rabbit gentleman and the
little girl, who had been found in a hollow stump,
were on their way through the woods to the fifteen
and sixteen cent barn where they sold
scooters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give me the best one you have for Baby
Bunty,” ordered Uncle Wiggily, and it was
given him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, may I ride home on it?” asked Baby
Bunty, when they were on the smooth woodland
path once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, yes, if you know how,” said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, all you have to do with a scooter,” spoke
Baby Bunty, “is to get on with your hind paws,
hold fast to the handle with your front paws,
give yourself a push and away you scoot!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me see you try it,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Maybe you’d better go first,” said Baby
Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, indeed!” laughed her uncle. “I’m
too old and stiff, and my rheumatism makes me
feel too funny to ride on a scooter. Go ahead,
Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty got on the foot-part of the
scooter. She held tightly with her front paws,
and gave herself a push with one hind paw.
Along went the scooter, but alas! Likewise
a-lack-a-day! Baby Bunty must have steered
the wrong way, for bunk! into a tree she ran.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, did you hurt yourself?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, as he ran to help her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no!” laughed the little rabbit girl. “It’s
fun when I get so I know how to do it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Off she started once more, but this time she
ran into a stump and bunked her nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you hurt?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—no,” said Bunty bravely. “But I must
be more careful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next time she steered very straight, but
she sent the scooter right into a mud puddle and
the mud splashed on Uncle Wiggily’s tall silk
hat. But, as the hat was black, the mud spots
do not show very plainly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Baby Bunty. “I don’t
believe I’ll ever learn how to ride my scooter.
I should have bought roller skates. Don’t you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>want to ride and show me how, Uncle Wiggily?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear me!” said the rabbit gentleman, unpretentious
like. “Do you think, at my age, I
could?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course!” said Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am lame and stiff and have the rheumatism,”
said Uncle Wiggily, “but I’ll try anything
once. Let me see that scooter, Bunty!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily got on with his hind paws.
He took hold with his front paws and he gave
himself a push. And, just as it would happen,
the scooter was then at the top of a hill. Down
this hill went the funny little two-wheeled wagon,
with Uncle Wiggily on it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stop! Oh, stop!” begged Mr. Longears, as
he saw what was before him. “I didn’t know this
was down hill! Stop!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was too late to stop! Down he went,
faster and faster. And the scooter traveled so
quickly that it rolled straight along and didn’t
go from side to side, or bunk into anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how wonderfully well Uncle Wiggily
rides!” said Baby Bunty at the top of the hill,
as she began to hop down.</p>

<p class='c008'>And just then, at the bottom of the hill, the
scooter, with Uncle Wiggily on it, struck a
stump. Up in the air went the rabbit gentleman,
and down he came with a thump. But he
landed on a bed of soft moss and wasn’t hurt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>a bit. The scooter came down with a bump
beside him. Uncle Wiggily looked around,
dazed like. Baby Bunty came hopping down
the hill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried. “That was
wonderful! But I didn’t know that was the
way to get off a scooter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t,” said Mr. Longears. “And don’t
you try that way, either. But I enjoyed my
ride. I’m not as stiff as I was, but I may be
more so tomorrow. Now I’ll give you some
lessons, Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The little rabbit girl soon learned to ride her
scooter, but not down hill, and she had lots of
fun. And if the clock doesn’t strike the dinner
bell and make the gas stove think it’s time for
supper before breakfast, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the flowers.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XVII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FLOWERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit
gentleman, was hopping through the woods one
day, wondering what Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy
would have for his dinner in the hollow stump
bungalow, when, suddenly, Mr. Longears heard
some one call:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily! Wait for
me! Oh, wait for me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Quickly the rabbit gentleman turned around,
and lowered his long ears, so they would not
stick up over the tops of the bushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am not sure, as yet, whether I want to
wait for whoever this is, or not,” said Uncle
Wiggily, cautious like and reserved. “If it’s the
Pipsisewah, or the Skuddlemagoon, I certainly
don’t want them to see me, or the see the souse
on my ears.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the voice cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Wait for me! Where
are you. I saw you a moment ago, but now I
can’t see you! Please wait for mee!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that’s Baby Bunty!” exclaimed Uncle
Wiggily, with a joyful twinkle of his pink nose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“My dear little baby rabbit, who was found in
a stump! Of course I’ll wait for her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Uncle Wiggily let his ears flop up, so
they could be seen over the bushes, and the little
rabbit girl cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, now I can see you! Wait a minute and
I’ll hop to where you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily sat on a stump and waited.
Pretty soon Baby Bunty came hopping along
the woodland path.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My goodness me, sakes alive and some peanut
butter cakes!” cried the rabbit gentleman.
“What is that yellow stuff on your paws, Baby
Bunty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Those are yellow flowers,” said Baby Bunty.
“I picked both my paws full of them, and I’m
going to give them to Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yellow flowers, eh?” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“Oh, so they are!” he went on, as he
brushed some cobwebs off his glasses. “It is very
kind of you to gather them for Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m glad you think so,” spoke Baby Bunty.
“Have a smell, Uncle Wiggily!” and she held
her bouquet of yellow blossoms under the pink,
twinkling nose of Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Baby Bunty, don’t!” begged Uncle Wiggily,
drawing back. “Oh, dear me! A-ker-choo.
Ker-snitzio! Bushwah! Bur-r-r-r!” and he
sneezed eleven-sixteen times.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Oh! Are you catching cold, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” answered the old rabbit gentleman.
“It’s just the flowers. They have some yellow
dust on them, and the petals are so ticklish that,
when they touched my nose, they made me
sneeze. I like your flowers, Baby Bunty, and
so will Nurse Jane, but please don’t hold them
so close to my nose again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” promised the little rabbit girl.
“Now we’ll have a nice game of tag! Come on,
chase me!” and away she hopped through the
woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi, there! Come back!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Don’t run so fast, Baby Bunty! You
may get lost or the Pipsisewah may catch you.
Come back!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you chase me! Come on, tag me!” cried
Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear, I suppose I’ll have to,” spoke
Uncle Wiggily, with a sort of sighing groan.
“But I’m so old and stiff-like——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But still he felt he must hop on to see that
no harm came to Baby Bunty. And that little
rabbit girl certainly led the old gentleman rabbit
a long chase.</p>

<p class='c008'>On through the woods hopped Baby Bunty,
carrying her yellow flowers, and after her
hopped Uncle Wiggily. All of a sudden Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Longears, looking ahead, saw the bad old Pipsisewah
jump out from behind a stump, and
make a grab for Baby Bunty!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear me, and some fire engine rice pudding!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “I should have
run faster after Baby Bunty to save her from
the Pipsisewah. Yet, even if I were there, what
could I do? And what can she do? Oh, this
is too bad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, as he watched, he suddenly saw brave
Baby Bunty thrust her bouquet of yellow flowers
into the very face of the Pipsisewah. Right
under his nose the little rabbit girl held the
fuzzy blossoms, and then the Pip quickly turned
a backward somersault and a forward peppersault
and he went:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ker-choo! A-ker-choo-choo! Kersnooziozoozium!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And he sneezed so hard that he sneezed himself
away up over the trees, and far enough off
so he couldn’t hurt Uncle Wiggily or Baby
Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, that’s the time the fuzzy, sneezy flowers
came in useful!” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he hopped up to Baby Bunty and found
her smiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now do you like my flowers?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Uncle Wiggily, “I do. And
I’ll carry one of the bouquets for you.” But he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>was careful to hold it away from his pink,
twinkling nose, as he didn’t want to sneeze as
hard as the Pipsisewah had done.</p>

<p class='c008'>So, everything came out all right, and if the
fried egg doesn’t go to sleep on the sofa cushion
and make the rocking chair think it’s a yellow
rose, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the white birch.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XVIII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WHITE BIRCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Where is Baby Bunty this morning?” asked
Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit gentleman,
as he came downstairs to a rather late
breakfast in his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want her to make you chase her, and
play tag, or gather more yellow flowers to give
the Pipsisewah a sneeze?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
as she poured some carrot gravy over Uncle
Wiggily’s lettuce pancakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, indeed, I don’t want Baby Bunty for
anything like that,” spoke Mr. Longears. “I
was just thinking, if she were off playing somewhere,
I could rest and not have to hop about
like a jumping Jack walking a tight rope.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Baby Bunty is good for you!” laughed
Nurse Jane. “Still, you needn’t worry now. She
is out of the way. She has gone over to play
with Beckie Stubtail, the little girl bear, and she
is going to stay to supper. Baby Bunty doesn’t
want to come home until after dark, and she told
me to ask you to go after her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” said Uncle Wiggily. “Hurray!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Much as I love Baby Bunty, I like to be quiet,
sometimes. Now I can eat my breakfast and
have a little sleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily did. In the afternoon he
took a hop through the woods and had a little
adventure with a frog lady. She was Mrs. No-Tail,
the mother of Bully and Bawly, and Mrs.
No-Tail fell into a pile of dry dust. Being fond
of water, she didn’t like being dry, but she might
never have gotten out of the dust if Uncle Wiggily
had not helped her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, after supper, Mr. Longears said to
Nurse Jane:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I will go over to Beckie Stubtail’s
house and get Baby Bunty. She won’t be
afraid to come home through the dark woods if
I am with her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” spoke Nurse Jane, “I hardly believe
she will. But be very careful coming through
the dark woods, Uncle Wiggily. The Pipsisewah
may be hiding there waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll be careful!” promised the bunny rabbit.
“But is there any favor I could do for you when
I go to bring home Baby Bunty?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied Nurse Jane, “there is. If you
have time, after you stop at the Stubtail house
for our little rabbit girl, I wish you’d step over
to Mrs. Wibblewobble’s, the duck lady. She
has a bag of sugar for me. It’s three pounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>she is giving me back for some she borrowed
of me to make cornmeal cakes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll stop at Mrs. Wibblewobble’s and get the
sugar, and also bring Baby Bunty home,” said
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he hopped off through the woods. It
was getting dark, but Uncle Wiggily didn’t care
about that. Baby Bunty might, but he never
would.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon the rabbit gentleman was at the home
of Beckie Stubtail, the little bear girl. As he
drew near he heard merry shouts and laughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The children are having a good time,”
thought Uncle Wiggily, and so they were.
When they knew he was there, Baby Bunty
wanted him to come in and play some games.
But Mr. Longears said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Baby Bunty! It is getting late, and I
have to stop at Mrs. Wibblewobble’s to get the
sugar for Nurse Jane. You may come over
again some other time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So, Baby Bunty said good night to Beckie
Stubtail, and then the little rabbit girl and
Uncle Wiggily started back through the dark
woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t you afraid?” asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a bit!” laughed Mr. Longears. He
noticed that Bunty hopped close to his side, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>did not run on ahead and want him to chase
her, as she often did.</p>

<p class='c008'>It did not take Uncle Wiggily and Baby
Bunty long to get to the duck house, and there
Mrs. Wibblewobble had the sugar wrapped up
in a paper bag for them. Then, once more, Mr.
Longears and Bunty started through the dark
woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what’s that?” suddenly asked the little
rabbit girl, stopping and pointing ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing but an old stump,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Come on!” They went along a little farther,
and Baby Bunty all of a sudden cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, look! There’s a giant!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. “That’s
only a big rock that looks like a giant. Hop
along!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They hopped along a little farther, and, all
at once, Baby Bunty gave a backward jump,
bunked into Uncle Wiggily so hard that she
burst the paper bag, letting the sugar spill out,
and she cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what’s that big, tall, white thing waving
its arms at us on the path? Oh, Uncle Wiggily!
What is it? What is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty snuggled close up against the
rabbit gentleman. Uncle Wiggily looked once,
he looked twice and he looked three times at the
white thing. Truly it did seem to be waving its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>arms in the dark. Then Uncle Wiggily laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that is only a white birch-bark tree,
Baby Bunty,” he said. “You mustn’t be afraid
of a white birch tree. And I’m glad we came
to this one. With some of the loose bark I can
make a new bag for the sugar. And I’ll be glad
to do it, for the sugar is running down my leg
and it tickles like sand at the seashore.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily made a bag from the white
birch bark, put the sugar in it, and he and Baby
Bunty were soon safe in the hollow stump bungalow.
And if the cough drop doesn’t fall off
toadstool and tickle rice pudding under the chin
when they’re in the moving pictures, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and the little pond.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XIX<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LITTLE POND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the bunny rabbit
gentleman, was hopping along through Woodland
near the Orange Ice Mountains, not far
from Asbury Grove, where he had built his hollow
stump bungalow. Mr. Longears was looking
first on one side of the path and then on
the other with his pink, twinkling nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>I mean Uncle Wiggily had his pink nose with
him; I don’t mean he was looking with it. Gracious,
no! He looked with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Uncle Wiggily! Are you looking for
an adventure?” asked Johnnie Bushytail, the
squirrel boy, as he scampered up a hickory tree
to see if any nuts were growing yet. But it was
too early.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I’m not exactly looking for an adventure,”
spoke the bunny gentleman. “I want to
find Baby Bunty, the little rabbit girl who used
to live in a hollow stump.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want her to chase you and play tag?”
asked Johnnie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, I do not!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Baby Bunty is too lively for me! She says she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>makes me chase her so I won’t get old and stiff.
But it’s fun to be sort of restful like once in a
while. Now I’m looking for Baby Bunty
because Nurse Jane wants her to come and
have her paws and face washed for supper.
Have you seen her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean Nurse Jane or Baby Bunty?”
asked the squirrel boy, sort of joking like and
comical.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty, of course!” answered Uncle
Wiggily. “I know where Nurse Jane is. She’s
baking a strawberry long-cake in my hollow
stump bungalow. But if you haven’t seen Baby
Bunty I must hop along and look in other
places.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily hopped along, and pretty
soon he came to the shore of a large pond. On
one bank of the pond were growing a number
of tall plants, with thick, green leaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! Those are nice plants,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “Perhaps they may have seen Baby
Bunty pass this way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So, understanding the language of flowers,
which is about the same as that which is talked
by the leaves and vines, Uncle Wiggily asked
the green plants if they had seen the little rabbit
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” answered one large plant, “we haven’t
seen Baby Bunty. We have been so busy trying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>to shake off a lot of bad, red, biting bugs,
on our stalks and leaves, that we haven’t had a
chance to look for any one. We wish we could
drive the bugs away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can do that,” kindly offered Uncle Wiggily.
“I will drive away the red bugs that are
biting your thick, green, glossy leaves. I’ll
knock them off with my red, white and blue
striped rheumatism crutch.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please do!” begged the plants growing on
the edge of the big pond.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily drove away the biting bugs
by tapping on the green, thick-leaved plants
with his crutch, and the plants thanked the rabbit
gentleman very much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we can ever do you or any of your friends
a favor we shall be glad to,” they said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily hardly thought a plant could
ever do you a favor, but just you wait and see.
On and on through the woods hopped the rabbit
gentleman, until pretty soon he came to a
cute little shady dingly dell, and there was Baby
Bunty lying on the grass fast asleep. In one
paw was her wooden doll—Sarah Jane Sassafras
Ricepudding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Bunty! Wake up!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Nurse Jane wants you to come home!
It’s nearly supper time!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Baby Bunty awakened with a start, rubbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>her eyes, and then, holding her doll, Matilda
Arabella Flapdoodle, in one paw, the little rabbit
girl took hold of Uncle Wiggily’s coat tail
and back to the hollow stump bungalow they
started.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had not gone very far, and they were
hopping toward the big pond of water, when,
all of a sudden, out from behind a stump popped
the bad old Skuddlemagoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ho! Now I have you!” cried the Skuddlemagoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty ran as fast
as they could. So did the Skuddlemagoon.
Pretty soon Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty
came to the big pond.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, if only this pond were little now,”
sighed Uncle Wiggily, “we could jump across
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What good would that do?” asked Baby
Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, once on the other side, we would be
safe from the Skuddlemagoon,” answered Uncle
Wiggily. “The policeman dog lives on the other
side of this pond. But, as it is now, it is too
big for us to jump across, and if we have to run
all the way around it the bad chap may catch us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, just as true as I’m telling you, all
of a sudden the big pond began to shrink up. It
shut its banks close together and became so little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>that Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty could
easily jump across without getting wet.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the way across the pond they jumped,
and, when they were safe on the other side, the
little pond suddenly stretched into a big one
again and it was so large that the Skuddlemagoon
couldn’t jump over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we’re safe, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Bunty.
“We’re safe! But what made the big pond get
little and then grow big again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” answered Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then some voices spoke: “We made the big
pond get little for you,” said the green stalks
and leaves on the bank. “We shrank and also
stretched the pond for you. We are rubber
plants, you know, and rubber can stretch and
shrink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That’s just how it happened. Weren’t those
stretchy rubber plants good to Baby Bunty and
Mr. Longears? And if the bluebell flower
doesn’t ring so late in the morning that the alarm
clock gets late for school, and can’t have any
sawdust candy for recess, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the funny stump.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XX<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FUNNY STUMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by, Uncle Wiggily! Good-by!” called
Baby Bunty to Mr. Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
one morning, as he stood on the front porch
of his hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that? ‘Good-by?’ Why, you aren’t
going to leave me; are you?” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Are you going to leave me after I found
you in the woods, and took care of you and—and
all that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but you say I make you chase me and
play tag, and that I won’t let you sit around
and get stiff and old and all the like of that!
I’d better go away,” and really it looked as
though Baby Bunty were going away, for she
had a little bundle in one paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t go away!” begged Uncle Wiggily.
“I don’t mind chasing you, and I was only fooling
about you making me get old and stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I was only fooling about going away!”
laughed Baby Bunty. “I’m only going to take
my painting lesson from Mother Nature. She
knows how to color the flowers red, blue and
golden, and she is giving me painting lessons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>My paints are in this bundle. When I finish
learning how to make a blue sky turn pink I’ll
come back to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please do!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I shall
miss you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, in an hour or so, if you walk through
the woods you may meet me coming home from
my painting lesson,” spoke Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will!” promised Uncle Wiggily. Then
Baby Bunty hopped on with her box of colors,
and Mr. Longears went to see Grandfather
Goosey Gander.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you s’pose Baby Bunty can paint?”
asked Grandpa Goosey, when Uncle Wiggily
had told about the little rabbit girl learning how
to make a green leaf look red.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what she can paint, but she is
a smart little thing,” said Mr. Longears. “It
would be hard to find her equal if you hopped or
waddled for one whole day and part of another.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe you!” quacked Grandpa Goosey
Gander.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pretty soon it was time for Uncle Wiggily to
start hopping along the woodland path to meet
Baby Bunty, for soon she would be leaving
Mother Nature’s studio, where the little rabbit
girl took her lessons.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must get Baby Bunty to give my red,
white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>crutch a new coat of paint,” thought Uncle
Wiggily, as he hopped along. “And I wonder
just where I shall meet her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>All of a sudden he heard a joyful sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi, there, Uncle Wiggily! Here I am!
Whoop-de-doodle-woodle!” and along hopped
Baby Bunty. There was a smudge of red
paint on one ear, a dab of blue paint on her left
paw and a dribble of yellow paint on her hair
ribbon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve been having my painting lessons,” she
said to Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see you have!” he agreed, with a laugh.
“Well, we’ll hop home now, and see what Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy has for supper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty were hopping
along, when, all of a sudden, out from
under a pile of dried grass jumped the bad old
Magoosielum. The Magoosielum is worse than
either the Pipsisewah or the Skuddlemagoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, ah! I’m in luck today!” cried the
Magoosielum. “A rabbit gentleman and a rabbit
girl! Let me see, whose souse shall I eat first?
I guess I’ll take yours, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With that the Magoosielum let go of Baby
Bunty, well knowing she would not run away
without Uncle Wiggily. Then the Magoosielum
began looking at the rabbit gentleman’s ears to
see where the best place would be to begin eating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>souse. For that is what souse is—pickled ears
of nice rabbits.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll take some left ear souse first,” said
the Magoosielum, and he was just starting to do
this, and Uncle Wiggily didn’t know what to do.
The rabbit gentleman saw Baby Bunty open her
paint box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will not help any,” sadly thought Uncle
Wiggily. “The only thing that will drive away
a Magoosielum is pineapple cheese, and Baby
Bunty has none of that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the bad animal stood in front of Uncle
Wiggily picking out a good place to begin nibbling
the souse, so Mr. Longears couldn’t see
what Bunty was doing with the paint box. All
he could see was that she was near a funny, old,
gnarled and fire-blackened stump.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, all of a sudden, Baby Bunty cried:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out now, you bad old Magoosielum.
Look out, or my friend, the Snippy-Snappy, will
get you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, as true as I’m telling you, there stood
what seemed to be a little, short, squatty animal,
with a big red mouth, a green nose, one yellow
eye and one pink eye, one brown cheek and one
purple one, and his teeth. Oh, his teeth were all
sorts of colors, some even being Skilligimink
shade!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, wow! Oh, this is terrible!” howled the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>bad Magoosielum. “Don’t let that Snippy-Snappy
get me! I won’t hurt you, Uncle Wiggily!”
And away ran the bad chap, not hurting
Mr. Longears nor Bunty at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But won’t the Snippy-Snappy get my souse?”
asked Mr. Longears, when he saw that the unpleasant
creature was gone. “Aren’t we in
danger from the Snippy-Snappy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not!” laughed Bunty. “I just
made the Snippy-Snappy on the outside of the
funny old stump, with my colored paints. I
painted the Snippy-Snappy, Uncle Wiggily, to
scare the Magoosielum.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And right well you scared him,” spoke the
bunny. “You surely are learning to paint,
Bunty.” And if the safety pin doesn’t slide off
the cushion and try to sprinkle soapsuds in the
eye of the needle, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the queer log.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XXI<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE QUEER LOG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Where’s Uncle Wiggily? Where’s Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Baby Bunty, the little rabbit
girl, of Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, one morning.
“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Uncle Wiggily has gone to the store
for me,” answered the muskrat lady housekeeper
of the hollow stump bungalow. “He has gone
to get me some molasses!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Baby Bunty, the little rabbit
girl, who had been found in a hollow stump.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, whatever is the matter?” asked Nurse
Jane, who had a dab of flour on her nose. And
whenever the muskrat lady had a dab of flour
on her nose you could be sure that she was making
a pie. “Don’t you like molasses cake,
Bunty?” Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes! Have you any?” Baby Bunty
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll make one as soon as Uncle Wiggily
comes back with the jug of molasses,” went
on Nurse Jane. “But why did you say ‘Oh,
dear!’ in such a doleful voice?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I wished Uncle Wiggily were here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to chase me, or play tag, or something! I’m
so afraid he’ll get old and stiff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, why don’t you hop off in the woods
and meet him?” asked Nurse Jane of the lively
little rabbit girl. Baby Bunty could hardly ever
keep still. “If you go to meet him you’ll see
him hopping along with the molasses jug,” went
on the muskrat lady, “and then he’ll chase you,
or play tag or let you help him carry the sweet
stuff I’m going to put in a cake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll do that,” said Baby Bunty, and away
she hopped with her rubber doll named Beatrice
Ethelmore Lemonsqueezer.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she was hopping through the woods to
meet Uncle Wiggily, all of a sudden Baby
Bunty heard, near a little spring of water, a
sad voice crying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m so wet! Oh, if some one would only
help me out of the water!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some one is drowning!” said Baby Bunty.
“I wonder if I could save them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>On a bed of soft, green moss, she put her
wax doll, Sarah Ann Belinda Washbasin, and
hurried to the side of the little spring. There
Baby Bunty saw a poor honey bee splashing in
the water.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll save you!” kindly said the little rabbit
girl. With a long stick she fished the half-drowned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>bee out of the pool, and placed him on
a leaf in the sun where his wings could dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you for saving me,” buzzed the bee,
when he had shaken off some of the water. “I
shall be glad to do you a favor, if I may. Do
you want me to make you some honey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, thank you, no; not now,” answered Baby
Bunty. “Uncle Wiggily is bringing home the
molasses jug. But some other time we may
want your honey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any time you do I’ll give you some,” buzzed
the bee. Then he flew away to look for more
honey flowers. Baby Bunty was glad she had
saved the bee, which a big dragon fly had knocked
into the spring of water.</p>

<p class='c008'>On and on through the woods hopped Baby
Bunty, and pretty soon she saw Uncle Wiggily
coming toward her, with the molasses jug on
his paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried the little rabbit
girl. “I’m so glad I met you. Now I’ll help
you carry the molasses jug and when we get
home you’ll chase me, and play tag; won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I guess so,” answered Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It will keep you from getting old and stiff,
you know,” said Baby Bunty sweetly, as she
took hold of one side of the molasses jug.</p>

<p class='c008'>She and Uncle Wiggily hopped on, but, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>of a sudden, out from behind a bush jumped
the bad old fox.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ho!” cried the fox. “This time I have
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He made a grab for Uncle Wiggily and
Bunty, but they were too quick for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Run, Bunty! Run!” cried Mr. Longears.
And he ran and hopped, and so did Bunty, and
they got away from the fox. But, alas, they
dropped the molasses jug and they didn’t dare
stop to pick it up, or go back after it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! What shall I do?” sighed Uncle
Wiggily. “I have lost the molasses and jug,
and Nurse Jane will be so disappointed! Oh,
dear!” and he sat down on a queer log, that had
a hole in each end, and warts like a toad all
over it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is too bad,” said Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is too bad?” asked a gentle, little voice,
and out of one end of the queer log flew the
very same honey bee that Baby Bunty had saved
from the spring. “What is too bad?” asked
the bee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The fox chased us and I lost the molasses
jug,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ho! Don’t let that worry you!” buzzed
the bee. “Inside this queer log I and many
other bees have a lot of flower honey. It is as
sweet as molasses, and I’ll give you all you want.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Here, make a box of some white birch bark from
this tree, and take Nurse Jane a lot of our
honey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that will be just fine!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “Nurse Jane can make honey cakes!”
And the muskrat lady did. So you see losing
the molasses jug didn’t so much matter after
all. And if the man in the moon doesn’t want
to come and live in our house and make the lady
bug move into the garage, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the lightning bug.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XXII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LIGHTNING BUG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Tag! You’re it!” cried Baby Bunty, the
little rabbit girl, one morning, as she ran around
on the porch of the hollow stump bungalow and
tapped Uncle Wiggily on his tall silk hat with
her paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! Now I suppose I’ve got to chase
you!” exclaimed the rabbit gentleman, as he
started his pink nose to twinkling. “And I’m
so stiff I can hardly run this morning!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mr. Longears chased the little rabbit
girl, and he really felt better after a lively race
around the hollow stump bungalow, so that some
of his stiffness was gone as he set forth, a little
later, to hop through the woods with Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of an adventure do you think we’ll
have today, Uncle Wiggily?” asked Baby
Bunty, as she hopped along beside the rabbit
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you never can tell,” he answered. “I
suppose the skillery-scalery alligator, or the bad
old Pipsisewah will come along and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly had Uncle Wiggily said these few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>words than he and Baby Bunty heard a sad
little voice saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear, me! Here I’m caught
in a sassafras tree!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who’s that?” asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know who it is, but I know who it
isn’t!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then who isn’t it?” asked Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t the Pipsisewah,” spoke the rabbit
gentleman. “He never uses poetry, though he
did eat some of your sugary frosted chocolate
cake the other day. But I must see who this is.
They may need help.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed I do!” went on the sad little voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lightning bug,” was the answer. “Some
persons call us fireflies, and that’s a good name,
too. But I am caught fast by my legs in the
sticky gum on this sassafras tree, and I can’t
get loose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll help you,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So will I,” added Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>She and Uncle Wiggily looked, and they saw
a little brown and drab bug on the branch of
a sassafras tree not far away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t look like a lightning bug,” said
Baby Bunty. “You don’t shine at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I only shine in the dark,” said the bug.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that is true; many times I have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>you, or your friends,” admitted Uncle Wiggily.
Then he gently set the firefly free from the
sticky gum, and the little bug flew away. But
before it left it said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“If ever I can help you, or Baby Bunty, I
shall be most glad to do so, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, pray, don’t mention it,” spoke the rabbit
gentleman, diffident-like and shy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty traveled on
and on over the fields and through the woods,
looking for an adventure, but they could not
seem to find any, unless you call helping the
lightning bug an adventure.</p>

<p class='c008'>And pretty soon it began to get dark, for
Uncle Wiggily had stayed out later than he
meant to.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Baby Bunty. “Hadn’t
we better get back to your hollow stump, Uncle
Wiggily?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I think so,” said the rabbit gentleman.
But when he tried to find the path that led to
home and Nurse Jane he could not. It was
too dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we are lost in the woods and the bad
Pipsisewah will get us,” cried Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” said Uncle Wiggily. “It will be all
right. I’ll light a fire here on this big stone.
The Pipsisewah, or no other wild animal, will
come where there is a fire!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
<img src='images/p114.jpg' alt='[Uncle Wiggily]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Then please light one,” begged Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when Uncle Wiggily tried to make the
fire he found he had no matches. And then,
all of a sudden, there was heard a crackling
and rustling in the bushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, the Pipsisewah is coming!” cried Baby
Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’d soon go away if I could make these
sticks burn!” said Uncle Wiggily, trying again
to find a match, but he could not.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Pipsisewah came nearer and nearer,
howling for rabbit-ear souse. And then, all of
a sudden, a little bright and shining light flew
through the air, and came down on the flat
stone where Uncle Wiggily had placed the sticks
to make a fire. And, in another moment ten
thousand other little points of light came flying
along. They dropped down among the dry
sticks and branches at the spot where Uncle
Wiggily had tried to make the blaze until it
looked as if the whole place were burning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, look!” cried Baby Bunty. “We have
a bonfire!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the Pipsisewah, seeing the bright light,
gave a grumble and growl and quickly sneaked
away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just my luck!” he said. “I thought I’d have
a bit of souse, but I don’t even dare go near
the fire!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>And Uncle Wiggily, looking among the sticks,
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This isn’t burning fire at all; it’s just a lot
of lightning bugs crawling on the pieces of
wood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that’s what we are,” said a voice. “I
am the lightning bug you saved from the sticky
gum, and these are my cousins and my sisters
and my aunts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you saved us from the Pipsisewah!”
said Uncle Wiggily, and so the lightning bugs
had. Then the firefly bugs flew on ahead, lighting
the path to the hollow stump bungalow for
the bunnies, and all was well.</p>

<p class='c008'>And if the loaf of bread doesn’t hide in the
flower pot when the rice pudding wants it to
help catch the raisins for a pie, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the roses.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XXIII<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE ROSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me!” exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy one day, as she walked down to the end
of her garden near the hollow stump bungalow.
“This is too bad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter now?” asked Uncle Wiggily
Longears. “Have Jackie and Peetie Bow
Wow, those two little puppy dog boys, been
digging up your seeds?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” answered the muskrat lady housekeeper
to the bunny rabbit gentleman, “not quite that.
But something has been eating my lovely roses.
And I wanted to keep them nice to send a bouquet
to Grandpa Goosey Gander.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! Some one has been eating your roses
have they, Nurse Jane?” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
animosity-like and determined. “Well, do
you think Johnnie or Billie Bushytail, the squirrels,
or Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck, or
perhaps Curly and Floppy Twistytail, the piggie
boys, could have taken the flowers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed!” said Nurse Jane. “They
wouldn’t do that. Some one seems to have been
chewing the lovely rose petals, that are like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>satin velvet, and also, many of the green leaves
are eaten.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I just know who did it!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “I know who has been eating your
roses!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who?” asked Nurse Jane, all excited like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Skuddlemagoon, the Skeezicks or the
Pipsisewah! Either one of those bad chaps!”
said the bunny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think so, too,” said Baby Bunty, who
hopped along just then, rolling her hoop. “Can
you catch them, Uncle Wiggily?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to try,” said the brave bunny
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, please don’t!” begged Nurse Jane. “I
don’t want you to run into danger, Uncle Wiggily,
and catching the Skeezicks, the Pipsisewah
or the Skuddlemagoon would be very dangerous.
The roses aren’t worth it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes they are,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But I am not going to run into danger. The
way I’ll catch whoever is eating your rose petals
will be this. I’ll hide out here in the grass, and
when I see the Skuddlemagoon, the Pipsisewah
or the Skeezicks sneaking up to bite a flower, I’ll
run out, sprinkle some salt on their tails and
that will make them behave.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, perhaps if you do it that way it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>be all right,” said Nurse Jane. “But do take
care of yourself, Uncle Wiggily; won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” promised the bunny rabbit gentleman.
So he got the big salt cellar out of the
kitchen, and then he hid himself in the tall grass
near the rose bushes in Nurse Jane’s garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to hide with you, too, and watch,”
said Baby Bunty. “I can tell you when the
Pipsisewah is coming, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, you may hide with me,” said Mr. Longears.
“You are a lively little rabbit girl, and
you will not fall asleep yourself, nor let me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, I won’t,” promised Baby Bunty, and
she kept tickling Uncle Wiggily with a piece
of ribbon grass on his pink, twinkling nose
every time he looked as though he were going
to doze off and fall asleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily and Baby Bunty had not been
hiding and watching very long before, all of a
sudden, the little rabbit girl whispered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here comes the Skeezicks!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh? The Skeezicks? So he does!” spoke
the rabbit gentleman softly, and, looking over
the top of the grass he saw the bad chap sneaking
along. The Skeezicks picked off a rose and held
it in his paw.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I’ll slip out and sprinkle salt on his
tail!” said Uncle Wiggily. And he was just
going to do this when Baby Bunty said:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“Oh, wait! Here comes the Skuddlemagoon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And, surely enough, into the garden came also
the bad Skuddlemagoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Two of ’em! This is going to be our busy
day!” said Uncle Wiggily softly, as he looked
to see if he had enough salt. “Well, I’ll tame
’em both! They must learn to let Nurse Jane’s
roses alone,” said he.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily was just going to hop out and
sprinkle salt on the tails of the Skeezicks and
the Skuddlemagoon, when Baby Bunty caught
him by the coat tails—she caught Uncle Wiggily,
I mean—and pulled him back down in the tall
grass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out! Here comes the Pipsisewah!”
cried the lively little rabbit girl, in a shrill
whisper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily looked. Surely enough there
was the old Pip, and just as the Skuddlemagoon
and the Skeezicks had done, the Pipsisewah
picked a rose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now we know who has been eating Nurse
Jane’s flowers,” said Uncle Wiggily to Baby
Bunty. “Well, here I go to sprinkle salt on
all three of their tails, and then we’ll see what
happens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Better wait,” said the little rabbit girl, and,
as she said that the Pipsisewah exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Now, gentlemen, I believe we are all ready.
Take a smell of your roses and then we’ll rush
up to the bungalow, grab Uncle Wiggily and
take away all his souse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right you are!” growled the Skuddlemagoon
and the Skeezicks. All three of the bad chaps
lifted the roses to their noses to smell the sweet
posies, when, all of a sudden, a big, black pinching
beetle flew out of the rose the Skeezicks had
and pinched him on the nose. And a big black
beetle flew out of the rose the Skuddlemagoon
held and pinched him on the nose. And then
a big black beetle flew out of the rose the Pipsisewah
held and pinched him on the nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wow! Wow! Wow!” cried the bad animals.
“This is too much!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And away they ran, not hurting Uncle Wiggily
at all, and they never took any more of
Nurse Jane’s flowers. And because the beetles
had been so brave they were given all the rose
leaf honey they wanted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now if the umbrella doesn’t run out in the
rain, and get its rubbers all wet so it can’t slide
down the ironing board, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the red tulip.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XXIV<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED TULIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Down in Nurse Jane’s garden, near the hollow
stump bungalow, grew many flowers besides the
roses, out of which flew the black beetles to nip
the noses of the Skeezicks, the Skuddlemagoon
and the Pipsisewah, as I have told you.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the flowers were big tulips, white,
golden and pink, and, best of all, Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, loved a tulip
that was red.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It makes me think of so many things that
are beautiful,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I could
look at the red tulip all day long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, please don’t look at it all day just
now, if you please!” begged Nurse Jane with a
laugh. “Far be it from me, Uncle Wiggily, to
hurt your feelings,” said she, “or to make you
stop loving my flowers. But it is getting late
afternoon now, and I have company coming for
tea. There isn’t a bit of sugar in the bungalow,
and unless you go to the seven and eight cent
store and get me some—well, my little tea party
will not be at all nice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, excuse me! I’ll go get the sugar at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>once,” said Uncle Wiggily. Then, putting on
his tall, silk hat, and taking his red, white and
blue striped rheumatism crutch off the garden
gate, Uncle Wiggily started to hop to the nine
and ten cent store for some sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I must take just one more look at the
red tulip,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I want to
remember how beautiful it was as I hop along
to the store.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So he went into the garden again, and stood
looking at the red flower, the petals of which
were spread wide open to let the sun warm the
heart of the blossom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Uncle Wiggily noticed that some weeds
were growing up too near the red tulip, so he
dug them out with the end of his red crutch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Weeds are not good for flowers,” said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just then Baby Bunty called to him from the
back kitchen window:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Wiggily, if you don’t stop fussing
over that tulip, and hurry on to the store, it will
be closed—I mean the store will be closed. It’s
getting late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and the tulip will be closed also,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “Tulip flowers close when
evening comes and open in the morning. But
I’ll hurry, Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Giving one last look at his favorite flower,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Uncle Wiggily hopped on to the ten and eleven
cent store. The afternoon was rapidly turning
into evening, and the bunny rabbit gentleman
hurried as fast as he could. But, just as Baby
Bunty had said, he had spent too much time
over the red tulip. The store was closed and
Uncle Wiggily could get no sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is too bad!” he exclaimed. “What am
I going to do for sugar for Nurse Jane’s tea!
She’ll be so disappointed. I’ll go see if I can
find another store that isn’t closed, as my red
tulip must be closed now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Uncle Wiggily hopped on through the
woods, but no other store could he find. And it
was getting later and later, and he knew it must
be almost time for Nurse Jane’s company to
arrive and have tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there is no help for it,” said the rabbit
gentleman, sort of ashamed like and perfunctory.
“I’ll just have to tell Nurse Jane I reached the
store too late. She’ll have to use molasses to
sweeten the tea. And yet that will not be at
all nice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Still there was nothing else to be done. If
it had been spring he could have gotten some
sweet maple sugar sap from a tree, but the sap
had stopped running.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess molasses is what she’ll have to use,”
said the bunny, as he hopped around the back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>way into his hollow stump bungalow. “I’ll take
one last look at my red tulip,” he said. He
wanted to put off, as long as possible, telling
Nurse Jane the bad news.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Wiggily reached the garden. His red
tulip had closed up its petals. Just as he had
expected, until the blossom looked more like a
bud than a full flower. And, as Uncle Wiggily
looked at the red tulip he heard, coming from
it, a voice which said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me out! Oh, please, let me out!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you and where are you?” asked the
rabbit gentleman in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am a buzzing bee and I am inside the red
tulip,” was the answer. “I was getting a bit of
yellow pollen on my legs, to help make wax,
when the tulip flower suddenly closed its petals
and I’m caught.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that is just what happened,” said the
red tulip. “I’m sorry, but it couldn’t be helped.
I’d open my petals and let you out, my dear bee,
but I can not, I can not open my petals until
morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but I can open them and I will, and I’ll
let the bee out,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But I’ll
do so very gently, my dear red tulip. I will not
hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Very carefully Uncle Wiggily opened the red
tulip and out flew the buzzing bee.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Thank you, Uncle Wiggily,” it said. And
then it went on: “But why do you look so sad
and worried?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I forget Nurse Jane’s sugar, or,
rather, I got to the store too late,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I can easily fix that,” said the bee.
“Since you were so kind as to let me out of the
red tulip, I’ll call a lot of my friends and we’ll
bring sweet honey for Nurse Jane’s tea.” And
the bees did, and so everything was all right, and
Nurse Jane said the honey was better than sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>And, if the clothes pin doesn’t try to climb
out of the thread box when it’s hiding away from
the cake of soap as they play tag, you shall next
hear about Uncle Wiggily and Bunty’s slippers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>STORY XXV<br> <span class='c006'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BUNTY’S SLIPPERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I think she is all ready now, except her
slippers,” said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is ready?” asked Uncle Wiggily Longears,
the bunny rabbit gentleman, as he hopped
up the steps of his hollow stump bungalow, in
time to hear his muskrat lady housekeeper ring
the dinner bell.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Baby Bunty,” answered Nurse Jane. “She
is all ready except her slippers, and I thought
you’d get them for her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll do almost anything for Baby Bunty
except chase her, or play tag, on the days when
I’m too lame and stiff,” said Uncle Wiggily, as
he sat down on the softest side of the porch, for
his rheumatism hurt him a little just then. “But
what’s all this about her slippers, and what is
Baby Bunty getting ready for?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, a little party that Alice Wibblewobble,
the duck girl, is going to give,” spoke Nurse
Jane. “I have made Baby Bunty a new dress
for it, and she has a new sky-blue-pink hair ribbon,
so she is all ready except her slippers. Will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>you go to the five and six cent store and get
them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I will!” said Uncle Wiggily with a
jolly laugh that made his nose twinkle like a piece
of cherry pie going to a moving picture show.
“I’ll hop right along,” said the bunny rabbit
gentleman, “and get Baby Bunty’s slippers.
Don’t let her go to the party until I get back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, she can’t go without her slippers,” spoke
Nurse Jane. “I’m going in now and curl her
fur.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So while the muskrat lady did this Uncle Wiggily
hopped over the fields and through the woods
to the seven and eight cent store to get Baby
Bunty’s party slippers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the rabbit gentleman had not gone very
far over hill and dale than, all at once, he saw a
nice hoptoad lady limping along the woodland
path, trying to carry a loaf of dandelion bread.
But she was going very slowly, was the hoptoad
lady, and, every now and then, she would drop
the loaf of bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, my dear Mrs. Toad, what’s the matter?”
kindly asked Uncle Wiggily as he caught
up to her. “Have you met with an accident?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say so,” was the answer. “An automobile
ran over my toes, and I can hardly walk;
much less carry the loaf of dandelion bread.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then allow me to carry it for you,” said Uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Wiggily. And he did, and he helped the hoptoad
lady limp to her home under an old log.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what it is to be lame and hardly able
to walk,” spoke Mr. Longears, as the toad lady
thanked him. “I am only too glad that I could
help you,” said he.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he hopped on a little farther and he met
a bumble bee caught fast in the sticky gum of a
pine tree. With his red, white and blue striped
rheumatism crutch, Uncle Wiggily helped the
bee get its legs free, and away it flew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I can ever help you I will, dear Uncle Wiggily,”
buzzed the bee.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the bunny uncle hopped on and on, and
pretty soon he came to the store where Nurse
Jane had told him to get Baby Bunty’s slippers.</p>

<p class='c008'>But alas! When he reached the place the store
was closed, for it was much later in the afternoon
than Uncle Wiggily had thought. It was so
light, and with the clocks being set an hour ahead,
you know, that he thought he had plenty of time.
But the store was locked for the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if I can’t get Baby Bunty’s slippers
here I’ll have to go to a drug store or somewhere
else,” thought the bunny rabbit. “Drug stores
keep open late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the drug stores did not sell party slippers
for little rabbit girls, and, though he tried in
many other places, and even in a moving picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>show, Uncle Wiggily could buy no slippers for
Baby Bunty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear! What shall I do?” thought Mr.
Longears. “Baby Bunty will be so disappointed!
She can’t go to the party without slippers! Oh,
dear! What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! Perhaps I can help you, Uncle Wiggily,”
said a buzzing voice. “I am the bumble
bee to whom you were so kind. I know where
there are a lot of lady slippers, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but Baby Bunty is too small to wear a
lady’s slipper,” said the rabbit. “But where are
those of which you speak?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right over here,” buzzed the bee, and he flew
over to where there was a large bed of the flowers
called “Lady’s Slippers.” He perched upon a
pink blossom and said: “Here are some very
small flowers, Uncle Wiggily, I’m sure they
would do for Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if they are too large I can make them
smaller,” said another voice. “I am the toad
lady whom you helped,” the voice went on, “and
I can take a tuck in the flower slippers with some
toad-flax, sewing them up, and making them just
fit Baby Bunty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I wish you would,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c008'>So he picked two of the smallest lady slipper
flowers which the bee pointed out, the toad lady
made them smaller, and Baby Bunty wore them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to Alice Wibblewobble’s party. And all the animal
girls said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, aren’t Baby Bunty’s slippers cute!”</p>

<p class='c008'>So everything came out all right.</p>
